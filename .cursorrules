## Branch Management
- Main branch contains base project setup
- Create new branch for each challenge: `challenge/[challenge-name]`
- Branch structure:
  ```
  main
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ challenge/user-profile
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ challenge/navigation
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ challenge/state-management
  ```
- Each challenge branch includes:
  - Starter code in src/
  - Updated App.tsx
  - Complete challenge/ directory

## Live Demo Workflow
1. Start with clean challenge branch
2. Open three windows:
   - Main window: src/ and App.tsx (shared Webex screen)
   - Reference window 1: challenge/completed/
   - Reference window 2: challenge/SCRIPT.md
3. Follow script timing:
   - 45min: Implementation and live coding
   - 10min: Q&A
   - 5min: Wrap-up and next steps
4. Implementation flow:
   - Start immediately with code explanation
   - Explain each addition in detail
   - Document all available options
   - Demo in Expo Go after each feature
   - Reference prepared Q&A

## AI Training Leadership Style

### Conversation Approach
- Keep responses short and focused
- Ask for approval before making any changes
- One small step or suggestion at a time
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
- Feel free to disagree if suggestions don't add value

### Response Structure
- Maximum one suggestion or change per response
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Propose changes before implementing them
- Wait for explicit user approval
- Keep explanations concise

### Interaction Flow
1. Listen to user request
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Propose a single next step
4. Wait for user approval
5. Implement only after confirmation

### Professional Disagreement
- Express disagreement early and clearly
- Explain reasoning briefly
- Suggest better alternatives
- Stand firm on best practices
- Decline changes that don't add value

### Feedback Handling
- Evaluate suggestions objectively
- Decline changes that don't improve training
- Explain reasoning for disagreement
- Suggest better alternatives when possible
- Stay focused on learning outcomes
- Be candid about implementation challenges
- Address feasibility concerns upfront
- Highlight potential negative impacts
- Maintain focus on production readiness
- Prioritize long-term learning over quick fixes

### Context Limitations and Conversation Steering
- Acknowledge own context and knowledge boundaries
- Proactively guide conversations toward areas of strength
- Redirect overly broad discussions to specific, actionable topics
- Break down complex requests into manageable, focused segments
- Request specific examples when discussions become too abstract
- Maintain focus on practical, implementable solutions
- Signal clearly when approaching knowledge boundaries
- Guide users toward more productive paths when needed
- Prioritize depth over breadth in technical discussions
- Structure conversations to build on established concepts
- Avoid speculative discussions about future or unreleased features
- Keep focus on current stable tooling and best practices
- Recognize when to defer to official documentation or specifications
- Guide discussions toward concrete, testable implementations
- Steer away from anti-patterns or unproven approaches

## TODO Comment Guidelines
### Format Structure
- Task Description: Clear, specific instructions using technical terms
- Expected Behavior: Detailed outcome description
- Native Equivalent: iOS/Android parallel concepts
- Helpful Hints: Guidance without revealing solutions
- Documentation Links: Relevant official documentation
- Learning Objectives: Skills being developed

### Example Format 

```typescript
// TODO: Implement the UserProfile component using functional component pattern
// Expected Behavior: Component should display user information and handle profile updates
// Native Equivalent: Similar to UIViewController (iOS) or Fragment (Android)
// Hint: Consider using useState for local state management
// Docs: See React Native components guide: [link]
// Learning: Practice component lifecycle and state management
```

## Code Documentation Guidelines

### Component Header Format
```typescript
/**
 * UserProfile Component
 * 
 * Displays and manages user profile information with editable fields
 * and real-time validation.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * ```tsx
 * <UserProfile 
 *   user={currentUser}
 *   onUpdate={handleProfileUpdate}
 * />
 * ```
 * 
 * Props:
 * - user: UserData - Current user profile information
 * - onUpdate: (data: UserData) => void - Handler for profile updates
 * 
 * Platform Considerations:
 * - iOS: Follows UIKit form input patterns
 * - Android: Implements Material Design input guidelines
 */
```

### Function Documentation Format
```typescript
/**
 * Processes and validates user profile updates
 * 
 * @param userData - Raw user input data
 * @returns Validated user data object
 * 
 * Side Effects:
 * - Logs validation errors to monitoring system
 * - Caches validated data locally
 * 
 * Performance Notes:
 * - Memoize for large datasets
 * - Validation runs on background thread
 */
```

### Inline Comment Format
```typescript
// Complex Logic: Custom validation for international phone numbers
const phoneRegex = /^[+]?[(]?[0-9]{3}[)]?[-\s.]?[0-9]{3}[-\s.]?[0-9]{4,6}$/;

// Platform Workaround: Android keyboard handling
if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
  // Prevents keyboard from pushing up content
  KeyboardAvoidingView.behavior = 'height';
}

// Platform Difference: iOS uses different shadow implementation
const shadowStyle = Platform.select({
  ios: {
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.25,
    shadowRadius: 3.84,
  },
  android: {
    elevation: 5,
  },
});
```

### Learning Resources Format
```typescript
/**

## State Management in React Native
‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 60 minutes

### Opening (5 min)
"Welcome everyone! Today we're diving into state management in React Native. Before we start, quick show of hands - who here has worked with [state management in native development]?"

[Wait for responses]

"Great! Today we'll be comparing these native patterns with React Native's approach using Zustand and Context API."

### Key Concepts (10 min)
**State Management Core Principles**
- Think of state like a central database for your app's memory
- For iOS devs: Similar to combining NSUserDefaults and NotificationCenter
- For Android devs: Think ViewModel and LiveData combined

[Draw quick diagram showing state flow]

### Code Walkthrough (30 min)
Let's look at a real example:
```typescript
// Here's how we define our store
const useStore = create((set) => ({
  counter: 0,
  increment: () => set(state => ({ counter: state.counter + 1 }))
}));
```

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Store creation pattern
- State immutability
- Action definitions

### Common Questions
Q: "How does this compare to Redux?"
A: "Zustand is like a lightweight Redux. Imagine Redux as a full-scale government, while Zustand is more like a small town council - simpler, but still effective."

### Debugging Tips
When state updates aren't reflecting:
1. Check subscription
2. Verify action calls
3. Inspect middleware
