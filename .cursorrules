- Documentation Links: Relevant official documentation
- Learning Objectives: Skills being developed

### Example Format 

```typescript
// TODO: Implement the UserProfile component using functional component pattern
// Expected Behavior: Component should display user information and handle profile updates
// Native Equivalent: Similar to UIViewController (iOS) or Fragment (Android)
// Hint: Consider using useState for local state management
// Docs: See React Native components guide: [link]
// Learning: Practice component lifecycle and state management
```

## Code Documentation Guidelines

### Component Header Format
```typescript
/**
 * UserProfile Component
 * 
 * Displays and manages user profile information with editable fields
 * and real-time validation.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * ```tsx
 * <UserProfile 
 *   user={currentUser}
 *   onUpdate={handleProfileUpdate}
 * />
 * ```
 * 
 * Props:
 * - user: UserData - Current user profile information
 * - onUpdate: (data: UserData) => void - Handler for profile updates
 * 
 * Platform Considerations:
 * - iOS: Follows UIKit form input patterns
 * - Android: Implements Material Design input guidelines
 */
```

### Function Documentation Format
```typescript
/**
 * Processes and validates user profile updates
 * 
 * @param userData - Raw user input data
 * @returns Validated user data object
 * 
 * Side Effects:
 * - Logs validation errors to monitoring system
 * - Caches validated data locally
 * 
 * Performance Notes:
 * - Memoize for large datasets
 * - Validation runs on background thread
 */
```

### Inline Comment Format
```typescript
// Complex Logic: Custom validation for international phone numbers
const phoneRegex = /^[+]?[(]?[0-9]{3}[)]?[-\s.]?[0-9]{3}[-\s.]?[0-9]{4,6}$/;

// Platform Workaround: Android keyboard handling
if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
  // Prevents keyboard from pushing up content
  KeyboardAvoidingView.behavior = 'height';
}

// Platform Difference: iOS uses different shadow implementation
const shadowStyle = Platform.select({
  ios: {
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.25,
    shadowRadius: 3.84,
  },
  android: {
    elevation: 5,
  },
});
```

### Learning Resources Format

## State Management in React Native
⏱️ Duration: 60 minutes

### Opening (5 min)
"Welcome everyone! Today we're diving into state management in React Native. Before we start, quick show of hands - who here has worked with [state management in native development]?"

[Wait for responses]

"Great! Today we'll be comparing these native patterns with React Native's approach using Zustand and Context API."

### Key Concepts (10 min)
**State Management Core Principles**
- Think of state like a central database for your app's memory
- For iOS devs: Similar to combining NSUserDefaults and NotificationCenter
- For Android devs: Think ViewModel and LiveData combined

[Draw quick diagram showing state flow]

### Code Walkthrough (30 min)
Let's look at a real example:
```typescript
// Here's how we define our store
const useStore = create((set) => ({
  counter: 0,
  increment: () => set(state => ({ counter: state.counter + 1 }))
}));
```

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Store creation pattern
- State immutability
- Action definitions

### Common Questions
Q: "How does this compare to Redux?"
A: "Zustand is like a lightweight Redux. Imagine Redux as a full-scale government, while Zustand is more like a small town council - simpler, but still effective."

### Debugging Tips
When state updates aren't reflecting:
1. Check subscription
2. Verify action calls
3. Inspect middleware
