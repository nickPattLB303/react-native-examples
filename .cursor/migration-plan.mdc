# MDC Migration Plan

## description
This document outlines the strategy for migrating all existing markdown rules to the `.mdc` format and optimizing the Cursor configuration for the React Native training repository.

## globs
[".cursor/**/*"]

## alwaysApply
true

## Migration Strategy

### Current State
- 12 markdown rule files in `.cursor/rules/`
- No existing `.mdc` files
- Current rules cover project structure, code standards, documentation, slides, and more

### Migration Approach
1. **Phase 1: Create `.mdc` Template**
   - Create a standard template for all `.mdc` files
   - Define consistent structure with `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply` fields
   - Establish naming conventions

2. **Phase 2: Convert Existing Rules**
   - Convert each markdown rule to `.mdc` format
   - Organize by category (structure, code, documentation, etc.)
   - Add appropriate glob patterns for each rule
   - Include relevant @ references to key files

3. **Phase 3: Optimize Structure**
   - Organize `.mdc` files into logical subdirectories
   - Create index `.mdc` files for each category
   - Eliminate redundancies across rules
   - Implement hierarchy of rules (general to specific)

4. **Phase 4: Implement Additional Tools**
   - Create `.cursorignore` file
   - Set up additional workflow improvements
   - Develop scripts and generators

5. **Phase 5: React Native Training Enhancements**
   - Add rules for Articulate 360 integration
   - Create instructor session management rules
   - Develop marketing/selling rules for React Native
   - Implement Slack channel integration rules

### Timeline
- Phase 1: Immediate (1 day)
- Phase 2: Short-term (2-3 days)
- Phase 3: Short-term (2-3 days)
- Phase 4: Medium-term (1 week)
- Phase 5: Medium-term (1 week)

### Priority Order for Rule Migration
1. project-structure.md → project-structure.mdc
2. code-standards.md → code-standards.mdc
3. documentation-standards.md → documentation-standards.mdc
4. slide-standards.md → slide-standards.mdc
5. remaining rules...
