## Description
This rule defines the modules that make up the React Native Training Course. These modules represent the main topics covered in the course and provide a high-level structure for all course content.

## Rule
The React Native Training Course consists of the following modules:

1. **Introduction to React Native**
   - Overview of React Native
   - Comparison with other frameworks
   - Setting up the development environment
   - React Native success stories and ecosystem benefits
   - **Advocacy Focus**: Overall value proposition and ecosystem overview

2. **React Native Fundamentals**
   - Components and JSX
   - Props and State
   - Styling and Layout
   - Comparative advantages over traditional approaches
   - **Advocacy Focus**: Developer productivity and code reusability

3. **Navigation and Routing**
   - React Navigation
   - Stack, Tab, and Drawer Navigation
   - Deep Linking
   - Cross-platform navigation consistency
   - **Advocacy Focus**: Cross-platform consistency with native feel

4. **Data Management**
   - State Management
   - Context API
   - Redux
   - Efficient cross-platform state solutions
   - **Advocacy Focus**: Efficient state management across platforms

5. **API Integration**
   - Fetch API
   - Axios
   - GraphQL
   - Backend connectivity patterns
   - **Advocacy Focus**: Seamless backend connectivity

6. **Native Device Features**
   - Camera
   - Geolocation
   - Push Notifications
   - Native module integration
   - **Advocacy Focus**: Native capabilities without platform-specific code

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memory Management
   - Rendering Optimization
   - Profiling and Debugging
   - Addressing performance concerns
   - **Advocacy Focus**: Addressing and overcoming performance concerns

8. **Deployment and Publishing**
   - Building for Production
   - App Store Submission
   - Google Play Store Submission
   - Cross-platform publishing benefits
   - **Advocacy Focus**: Streamlined publishing to multiple platforms

Each module must include:
- Clear learning objectives
- Comprehensive content covering all topics
- Hands-on exercises
- End-of-module challenge
- React Native advocacy elements (success stories, comparative demonstrations, etc.)
- Technical depth at surface, mid, and deep levels

Module naming convention:
- module-[number]-[name]
- Example: module-1-react-native-fundamentals

Each module should be completable within 1-2 days of training, depending on the learning path.

## Examples
- Proper module directory naming: `module-1-react-native-fundamentals`
- Proper documentation reference: "As we covered in Module 3: Web Development Essentials..."
- Proper slide organization: [Module 7 Slides](mdc:docs/slides/module-7-react-native-ui-and-styling)
- Proper module README structure: See [Module 1 README](mdc:docs/module-1-react-native-fundamentals/README.md) for an example
