# Articulate 360 Compatibility

[README.md](mdc:README.md)
[README.md](mdc:docs/README.md)
[Cursor Rules README](mdc:.cursor/README.md)

This rule ensures that content created for the React Native Training Course maintains compatibility with Articulate 360 for parallel e-learning development, without impeding repository progress.

## Core Principles

1. **Repository First, Articulate Second**: Prioritize building a complete, high-quality repository. Articulate conversion is a secondary concern that should not slow down repository development.

2. **Conversion-Friendly Structure**: Create content with future conversion in mind, but don't let it dictate your approach.

3. **Documentation Over Constraints**: Document conversion considerations rather than enforcing strict limitations on repository content.

## Practical Implementation Guidelines

### Content Development Approach

1. **Develop for the Repository**: Focus on creating the best possible content for the repository format first.

2. **Articulate Conversion Notes**: Include brief notes about Articulate conversion as you go, but don't let this slow down development.

3. **Batch Conversion Planning**: Plan for Articulate conversion as a separate phase rather than trying to develop both simultaneously.

### Content Structure Considerations

When creating repository content, keep these Articulate-friendly practices in mind:

1. **Logical Content Chunks**: Break content into logical sections that could reasonably become individual Articulate slides or slide sequences.
   
2. **Visual Assets**: 
   - Save source files for all diagrams and complex visuals
   - Consider creating alternate versions of complex diagrams that might need to be simplified for Articulate
   - Use consistent image dimensions where possible

3. **Code Examples**:
   - Break complex code examples into smaller, focused snippets
   - Include clear annotations that can be converted to Articulate callouts
   - Consider which code examples are essential vs. supplementary

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - For each exercise, briefly note how it might translate to Articulate (e.g., "Could be a drag-and-drop activity")
   - Design exercises with multiple difficulty levels that can be adapted to different Articulate interaction types

### Simplified Articulate Notes

At the end of each module or major section, include a brief "Articulate Conversion Notes" section:

```markdown
#### Articulate Conversion Notes

**Key Visuals**: 
- Component hierarchy diagram (will need simplification)
- State flow chart (consider animation in Articulate)

**Interactive Opportunities**:
- The component matching exercise could use Articulate's matching interaction
- Consider converting the debugging challenge to a scenario-based interaction

**Potential Challenges**:
- The live coding section will need an alternative approach in Articulate
```

### Asset Management

Maintain a simple tracking system for assets that will need special handling in Articulate:

1. **Create an assets directory** with subdirectories for source files, diagrams, and complex visuals
2. **Use consistent naming conventions** that make the purpose and module association clear
3. **Include a simple README in each asset directory** noting special considerations for Articulate

## Validation Approach

Keep validation lightweight and non-blocking:

1. **Optional Checks**: Run Articulate compatibility checks separately from main validation
2. **Warning-Only**: Treat Articulate compatibility issues as warnings, not errors
3. **Focus on Major Issues**: Only flag significant problems that would make conversion difficult

## Reference Resources

For detailed guidance on Articulate conversion, refer to:
- [Articulate Integration Guide](mdc:docs/articulate-integration.md)
- Example converted modules (once available)

## Balancing Progress with Conversion Planning

Remember these key principles:

1. **Don't Overoptimize**: It's better to have complete repository content that needs adaptation than incomplete content that's perfectly Articulate-ready.

2. **Leverage Articulate's Strengths**: Some content may actually work better when reimagined for Articulate rather than directly converted.

3. **Separate Concerns**: Keep repository development and Articulate planning as related but separate workflows.

4. **Document Decisions**: When you make choices that might affect Articulate conversion, briefly document your reasoning.

By following these guidelines, you'll create high-quality repository content that can be efficiently converted to Articulate 360 without letting the conversion requirements slow down your primary development work.
