# Articulate 360 Compatibility

[README.md](mdc:README.md)
[README.md](mdc:docs/README.md)

This rule ensures that content created for the React Native Training Course maintains compatibility with Articulate 360 for parallel e-learning development.

## Content Structure Compatibility

When creating content, ensure it follows these guidelines for Articulate compatibility:

1. **Modular Content Blocks**: Create content in discrete, self-contained modules that can be independently imported into Articulate 360.
   
2. **Limited Nesting**: Keep heading hierarchy simple (H1 → H2 → H3) as deep nesting may not translate well to Articulate slides.
   
3. **Standard Markdown Elements**: Prioritize standard elements (lists, tables, code blocks, images) that have direct equivalents in Articulate.
   
4. **Image Dimensions**: Keep images under 1280px wide to ensure they display properly in Articulate without rescaling.
   
5. **Video Compatibility**: For video content, provide links to externally hosted videos (YouTube/Vimeo) rather than embedded files.


## Documentation Protocols

For each module or significant content piece:

1. **Articulate Import Notes**: Add a section at the end of each module with specific notes for Articulate implementation.
   
2. **Asset Inventory**: Maintain a list of all assets (images, code samples) needed for Articulate recreation.
   
3. **Interaction Map**: Document which content sections should become interactive elements in Articulate.



Following these guidelines will ensure that course materials developed in this repository can be efficiently translated to Articulate 360 with minimal rework.
