# Course Modules

## Description
This rule defines the modules that make up the React Native Training Course. These modules represent the main topics covered in the course and provide a high-level structure for all course content.

## Rule
The React Native Training Course consists of the following modules, which should be referenced consistently across all documentation, slides, exercises, and challenges:

1. React Native Fundamentals
2. Environment Setup
3. Web Development Essentials
4. JavaScript Essentials
5. TypeScript Essentials
6. React Essentials
7. React Native UI and Styling
8. Components and User Input
9. Navigation and Routing
10. State Management
11. Performance and Debugging
12. Advanced Features
13. Capstone Project

- All content must be organized according to this module structure
- Module numbers must be used consistently in file paths, documentation references, and slide organization
- Each module should have its own directory in the docs branch following the pattern `module-X-name-with-hyphens`

## Examples
- Proper module directory naming: `module-1-react-native-fundamentals`
- Proper documentation reference: "As we covered in Module 3: Web Development Essentials..."
- Proper slide organization: `/docs/slides/module-7-react-native-ui-and-styling/`
