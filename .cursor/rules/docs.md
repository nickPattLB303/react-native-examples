# Documentation Rules
Pattern: docs/**/*.md
Description: Rules for documentation files in the course

Follow these guidelines when working with documentation files:
- Follow ADDIE model
- Use Microsoft Writing Style Guide conventions
- Include links to official documentation where relevant
- Use consistent formatting for code examples
- Include detailed "under the hood" technical explanations
- Add platform-specific callouts for Android/iOS/Angular/React developers
- Add Skip/Skim callouts for concepts already familiar to Angular/React developers
