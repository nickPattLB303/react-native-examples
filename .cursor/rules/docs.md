# Documentation Rules
Pattern: docs/**/*.md
Description: Rules for documentation files in the course

Follow these guidelines when working with documentation files:
- Use Microsoft Writing Style Guide conventions
- Include callout boxes for different learning paths using the format:
  > [Instructor-Led] Content specific to instructor-led path
  > [Self-Led] Content specific to self-led path
  > [Async] Content specific to async learning path
- Maintain clear separation between basic and advanced topics
- Include links to official documentation where relevant
- Use consistent formatting for code examples
- Include detailed "under the hood" technical explanations
- Add platform-specific callouts for Android/iOS/Web developers
