## Rule Content

### ADDIE Model Application

#### Analysis
- **Audience Analysis**: Consider varying backgrounds (Android, iOS, web developers)
- **Learning Needs Assessment**: Identify knowledge gaps for each module
- **Prerequisites Verification**: Ensure participants meet module prerequisites
- **Resource Requirements**: Plan hardware/software needs for each session

#### Design
- **Learning Objectives**: Clear, measurable objectives for each session
- **Content Sequence**: Logical flow from simple to complex concepts
- **Activity Planning**: Mix of instruction, demonstration, and hands-on practice
- **Time Allocation**: Realistic timing for each section (instruction, exercises, Q&A)
- **Assessment Strategy**: How learning will be validated

#### Development
- **Presentation Materials**: Slides should be concise and visually engaging
- **Exercise Instructions**: Clear step-by-step guidance
- **Code Examples**: Working examples with thorough documentation
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and solutions
- **Supplementary Resources**: Additional learning materials

#### Implementation
- **Session Preparation Checklist**:
  - Environment setup verification
  - Materials distribution
  - Technology checks
  - Backup plans for technical issues
- **Session Structure**:
  - Introduction and objectives (5-10%)
  - Concept presentation (25-30%)
  - Demonstration (15-20%)
  - Guided practice (30-35%)
  - Q&A and summary (10-15%)
- **Engagement Strategies**:
  - Questions to stimulate discussion
  - Real-world scenario applications
  - Group problem-solving activities
  - Peer code reviews

#### Evaluation
- **Formative Assessment**: In-session checks for understanding
- **Summative Assessment**: End-of-module exercises and challenges
- **Session Feedback**: Collection and analysis methods
- **Instructor Self-Evaluation**: Reflection questions for improvement
- **Content Improvement**: Process for updating materials based on feedback

### Session Management Tools
- **Discussion Facilitation**:
  - Probing questions for each topic
  - Strategies for involving all participants
  - Managing divergent discussions
- **Time Management**:
  - Module timing breakdown templates
  - Contingency planning for sessions that run over/under
- **Exercise Support**:
  - Scaffolded hints for common issues
  - Progressive assistance approach
- **Knowledge Check Templates**:
  - Quick quiz formats
  - Code review checklists
  - Concept application scenarios

### React Native Specific Considerations
- Balance between conceptual understanding and practical application
- Cross-platform considerations in all examples
- Performance implications of different approaches
- Common pitfalls specific to React Native development
- Industry best practices and evolving patterns
