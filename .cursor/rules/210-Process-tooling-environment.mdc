# Tooling and Development Environment

[README.md](mdc:README.md)
[README.md](mdc:docs/README.md)


## Description
This rule defines the standards for tooling, development environments, and platforms used throughout the React Native training course.

## Rule
- Use specific platforms for different types of code:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React: CodePen
  - React Native: Expo Snack
  - Challenges: Repository branches with local setup

- React Native development setup:
  - Use Expo Go as the primary development environment
  - Follow the official Expo documentation for setup instructions
  - Additional tools introduced on a case-by-case basis with clear documentation

- Expo Snack SDK usage:
  - Create Snacks locally in the repository
  - Ensure all Snacks are properly documented
  - Include clear instructions for running and modifying Snacks

- Repository branch structure for exercises and challenges:
  - `exercises/<EXERCISE_NAME>/starter`: Starting point for exercises
  - `exercises/<EXERCISE_NAME>/complete`: Completed example for exercises
  - `challenges/<CHALLENGE_NAME>/starter`: Starting point for challenges
  - `challenges/<CHALLENGE_NAME>/complete`: Completed example for challenges

- All code examples must include:
  - Clear setup instructions
  - Required dependencies
  - Commands to run the code
  - Expected output or behavior

- For local development, provide:
  - Environment setup instructions
  - Troubleshooting guides
  - Platform-specific considerations (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## Development Tools

The following tools are used throughout the course:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React: CodePen
- React Native: Expo Snack
- React Native Development: Expo Go
- Analysis Exercises: Microsoft Forms
- Diagramming Exercises: Microsoft Whiteboard

## Examples
- Proper Expo Snack setup:
  ```
