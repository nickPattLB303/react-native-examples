## In Progress

### Migration from Cursor to Roo Code
- [ ] Test Roo Code integration with the project
- [ ] Validate that all content from Cursor rules has been properly migrated
- [ ] Document the migration process for future reference

## Next Steps

1. **Validate migration**:
   - Ensure all content from Cursor rules has been properly migrated
   - Test Roo Code integration with the project
   - Verify that all memory-bank files are properly structured

2. **Document migration process**:
   - Create documentation on how the migration was performed
   - Include any lessons learned or best practices
   - Provide guidance for future migrations

3. **Clean up**:
   - Decide whether to keep or remove the original Cursor rules
   - Update any references to Cursor rules in the project

## Blockers

- None currently identified

## Notes

- The migration process involves transferring content from the Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` to the appropriate Roo Code memory-bank files.
- The goal is to maintain the same level of guidance and structure while leveraging the Roo Code format.
- The Roo Code memory-bank structure provides a more organized way to manage project context and documentation.
- All core memory-bank files have been created and populated with content from the Cursor rules.
