## In Progress

### Course Delivery Preparation
- [ ] Test external tools integration (CodePen, Expo Snack, etc.)
- [ ] Verify all links and references in documentation
- [ ] Create instructor checklists for each module

### React Native Advocacy Materials Development
- [ ] Compile compelling React Native success stories for each module
- [ ] Create comparative code demonstrations for key features
- [ ] Develop responses to common skepticism points
- [ ] Create developer experience highlight examples

## Next Steps

1. **Prepare for course delivery**:
   - Test all external tools and resources (CodePen, Expo Snack, etc.)
   - Verify that all links and references are working correctly
   - Create instructor checklists for each module

2. **Enhance training materials**:
   - Create supplementary resources for challenging concepts
   - Develop quick reference guides for each module
   - Consider creating video walkthroughs for complex exercises

3. **Implement feedback mechanisms**:
   - Develop session feedback forms
   - Create a process for incorporating feedback into future iterations
   - Establish metrics for measuring training effectiveness

4. **Develop React Native advocacy materials**:
   - Research and document compelling case studies and success stories
   - Create before/after code comparisons showing React Native advantages
   - Develop a "skepticism FAQ" with evidence-based responses
   - Create visualizations of the React Native ecosystem and community

## Blockers

- None currently identified

## Notes

- The project has a comprehensive structure with well-organized documentation and slides
- The course is designed to support multiple learning paths: instructor-led, self-led, and async topic-specific learning
- All materials follow a consistent pharmacy/medication theme
- The course includes a mix of theoretical content, practical exercises, and challenges
- New focus on React Native advocacy will help overcome developer skepticism and build enthusiasm
