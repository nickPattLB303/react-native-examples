## Next Steps

1. **Prepare for course delivery**:
   - Test all external tools and resources (CodePen, Expo Snack, etc.)
   - Verify that all links and references are working correctly
   - Create instructor checklists for each module

2. **Enhance training materials**:
   - Create supplementary resources for challenging concepts
   - Develop quick reference guides for each module
   - Consider creating video walkthroughs for complex exercises

3. **Implement feedback mechanisms**:
   - Develop session feedback forms
   - Create a process for incorporating feedback into future iterations
   - Establish metrics for measuring training effectiveness

## Blockers

- None currently identified

## Notes

- The project has a comprehensive structure with well-organized documentation and slides
- The course is designed to support multiple learning paths: instructor-led, self-led, and async topic-specific learning
- All materials follow a consistent pharmacy/medication theme
- The course includes a mix of theoretical content, practical exercises, and challenges
