# Active Context

## Current Session: Migration from Cursor to Roo Code

### Current Task
Migrating Cursor rules to Roo Code format, ensuring all content is properly transferred to the appropriate files in the memory-bank structure.

### Active Files
- `.clinerules` - Main configuration file for Cline (older version of Roo Code)
- `.roomode` - Main configuration file for Roo Code
- `memory-bank/productContext.md` - Project overview
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current session context (this file)
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Progress tracking
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - System patterns and conventions
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Technical context

### Current Focus
Converting the content from the Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` to the appropriate Roo Code memory-bank files while maintaining all the important information and context.

### Open Questions
1. Are there any specific Roo Code features that should be leveraged beyond the basic memory-bank structure?
2. Should we maintain both Cursor and Roo Code configurations simultaneously during the transition?
3. Are there any additional memory-bank files that would be beneficial for this project?

### Notes
- The Cursor rules contain valuable information about the React Native Training Course project structure, standards, and processes.
- The migration should ensure that all this information is properly organized in the Roo Code memory-bank structure.
- The goal is to maintain the same level of guidance and structure while leveraging the Roo Code format.
