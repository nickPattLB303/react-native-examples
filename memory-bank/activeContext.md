# Active Context

## Current Session: Training Session Planning with React Native Advocacy

### Current Task
Analyzing the project structure and materials to determine the optimal approach for running React Native training sessions that effectively market and sell React Native to participants.

### Active Files
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `docs/` - Documentation directory
- `docs/slides/` - Presentation slides
- `docs/module-1-react-native-fundamentals/` - Module 1 content
- `memory-bank/productContext.md` - Project overview
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current session context (this file)
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Progress tracking
- `memory-bank/projectBrief.md` - Project brief information
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - System patterns including advocacy patterns

### Current Focus
Determining the best approach for running training sessions that not only teach React Native effectively but also overcome skepticism and build enthusiasm among developers with varying backgrounds and preferences.

### Open Questions
1. How should the instructor balance between slides and hands-on exercises?
2. What customizations might be needed for different learning paths (instructor-led, self-led, async)?
3. How should the challenges and exercises be integrated into the training flow?
4. What additional materials might be needed to support the training sessions?
5. What specific strategies will be most effective for overcoming developer skepticism about React Native?
6. How can we incorporate real-world success stories most effectively throughout the course?
7. What comparative demonstrations will be most compelling for developers coming from different backgrounds?

### Notes
- The project has a well-structured set of slides in the `docs/slides/` directory
- The documentation in `docs/` provides detailed content for each module and section
- The project supports multiple learning paths: instructor-led, self-led, and async topic-specific learning
- The course follows a consistent pharmacy/medication theme throughout all examples
- A new focus on React Native advocacy has been added to address developer skepticism and build enthusiasm
- Each module now includes specific advocacy elements to build buy-in throughout the course
