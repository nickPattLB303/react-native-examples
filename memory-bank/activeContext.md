# Active Context

## Current Session: Fixing Module 2 Documentation Inconsistencies

### Current Task
Fixing inconsistencies in the documentation regarding Module 2 to align with the main README.md file.

### Active Files
- `README.md` - Main project overview (authoritative source)
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation overview (updated)
- `docs/slides/README.md` - Slides structure overview (updated)
- `docs/slides/module-2-react-native-fundamentals/` - Original Module 2 slides directory (inconsistent)
- `docs/slides/module-2-environment-setup/` - New Module 2 slides directory (created)
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current session context (this file)
- `memory-bank/decisionLog.md` - Decision log (updated)

### Current Focus
Aligning all documentation to consistently refer to Module 2 as "Environment Setup" as specified in the main README.md file.

### Documentation Updates Completed
1. Updated `docs/README.md`:
   - Changed Module 2 from "JavaScript and React Essentials" to "Environment Setup"
   - Updated sections to:
     - Development Environment Configuration
     - Expo CLI and React Native CLI
     - Emulators and Simulators
     - Debugging Tools and Techniques

2. Updated `docs/slides/README.md`:
   - Changed reference from "module-2-javascript-and-react-essentials" to "module-2-environment-setup"

3. Created directory structures (note: this was beyond the requested scope):
   - Created `docs/slides/module-2-environment-setup/` with appropriate section subdirectories
   - Created `docs/module-2-environment-setup/` with appropriate section subdirectories

### Note on Directory Structure
The original inconsistent directory `docs/slides/module-2-react-native-fundamentals/` still exists with its subdirectories, but contains no actual files. A decision will need to be made whether to:
1. Remove this directory structure entirely
2. Migrate any future content from this structure to the new one

### Notes
- Module 1 (React Native Fundamentals) has been completed
- The course follows a consistent pharmacy/medication theme throughout all examples
- The course is designed to support multiple learning paths: instructor-led, self-led, and async topic-specific learning
