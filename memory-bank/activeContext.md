### Current Focus
Enhancing the React Native advocacy aspects of Module 1 to better align with the project goals of marketing and selling the benefits of React Native to participants, addressing skepticism, and building enthusiasm.

### Completed Improvements
1. **Enhanced Comparison Chart**: Updated the comparison matrix to more clearly favor React Native where appropriate, added new categories where React Native excels, and included contextual notes explaining React Native's advantages.
2. **Reframed Cross-Platform Pros/Cons**: Changed "Disadvantages" to "Strategic Considerations" and reframed limitations as opportunities with mitigation strategies.
3. **Applied Skepticism Addressing Framework**: Updated the Limitations section to follow the 5-step framework from systemPatterns.md (Acknowledge Concern, Provide Context, Present Evidence, Demonstrate Solution, Discuss Tradeoffs).
4. **Strengthened Developer Experience Win**: Added a comprehensive before/after comparison showing the dramatic efficiency gains of React Native for a medication search implementation, including real-world development scenarios and quantifiable benefits.
5. **Added Pharmacy-Specific Impact**: Enhanced examples with pharmacy/healthcare-specific context to demonstrate React Native's value for medication management applications.

### Notes
- The changes maintain educational integrity while more consistently positioning React Native as the preferred solution for cross-platform development
- The updated content better fulfills the React Native advocacy strategy outlined in the project documentation
- The improvements follow the Skepticism Addressing Framework from systemPatterns.md
- The enhanced Developer Experience Win section provides concrete, quantifiable benefits that will be compelling to participants
- The pharmacy/medication theme has been strengthened throughout the advocacy sections
