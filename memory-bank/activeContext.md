# Active Context

## Current Session: Training Session Planning

### Current Task
Analyzing the project structure and materials to determine the optimal approach for running React Native training sessions.

### Active Files
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `docs/` - Documentation directory
- `docs/slides/` - Presentation slides
- `docs/module-1-react-native-fundamentals/` - Module 1 content
- `memory-bank/productContext.md` - Project overview
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current session context (this file)
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Progress tracking
- `memory-bank/projectBrief.md` - Project brief information

### Current Focus
Determining the best approach for running training sessions based on the project's goals, structure, and available materials.

### Open Questions
1. How should the instructor balance between slides and hands-on exercises?
2. What customizations might be needed for different learning paths (instructor-led, self-led, async)?
3. How should the challenges and exercises be integrated into the training flow?
4. What additional materials might be needed to support the training sessions?

### Notes
- The project has a well-structured set of slides in the `docs/slides/` directory
- The documentation in `docs/` provides detailed content for each module and section
- The project supports multiple learning paths: instructor-led, self-led, and async topic-specific learning
- The course follows a consistent pharmacy/medication theme throughout all examples
