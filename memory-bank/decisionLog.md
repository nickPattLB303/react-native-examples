# Decision Log

This document tracks key implementation decisions made during the development of the React Native Training Course project.

## Migration from Cursor to Roo Code

### Decision: Migrate Cursor Rules to Roo Code Memory Bank
- **Date**: Current date
- **Decision**: Migrate all Cursor rules to Roo Code memory-bank structure
- **Rationale**:
  - Roo Code provides a more structured approach to project context and documentation
  - Memory-bank files are more organized and easier to maintain
  - Roo Code offers better integration with different modes (Code, Architect, Ask, Debug)
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Keep using Cursor rules
  - Use a hybrid approach with both Cursor rules and Roo Code
- **Impact**:
  - All project guidance and standards are now maintained in the memory-bank structure
  - Development workflow will leverage Roo Code's mode-based approach
  - Better organization of project context and documentation

### Decision: Structure of Memory Bank Files
- **Date**: Current date
- **Decision**: Create the following memory-bank files:
  - `productContext.md`: Project overview
  - `activeContext.md`: Current session context
  - `progress.md`: Progress tracking
  - `systemPatterns.md`: System patterns and conventions
  - `techContext.md`: Technical context
  - `decisionLog.md`: Implementation decisions
  - `projectBrief.md`: Project brief
- **Rationale**:
  - This structure covers all aspects of the project that were previously in Cursor rules
  - Each file has a clear purpose and scope
  - The structure follows Roo Code best practices
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Using fewer, more consolidated files
  - Creating additional specialized files for specific aspects
- **Impact**:
  - Clear organization of project information
  - Easy access to specific types of information
  - Maintainable documentation structure

### Decision: Content Migration Strategy
- **Date**: Current date
- **Decision**: Migrate content from Cursor rules to memory-bank files based on topic and purpose
- **Rationale**:
  - Ensures all valuable information is preserved
  - Organizes content in a more logical structure
  - Maintains the same level of guidance and standards
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Simplified migration with less detailed organization
  - Complete restructuring of content
- **Impact**:
  - All important information from Cursor rules is preserved
  - Content is now organized in a more accessible way
  - Future updates will be easier to manage

## Training Session Planning

### Decision: Training Session Implementation Approach
- **Date**: February 27, 2025
- **Decision**: Implement a blended approach for training sessions that combines structured slide presentations with hands-on exercises, tailored to different learning paths
- **Rationale**:
  - The project has well-structured slides and documentation that support multiple learning approaches
  - Different learning paths (instructor-led, self-led, async) require flexible implementation strategies
  - Hands-on exercises and challenges are essential for practical skill development
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Strictly following slides in a linear presentation format
  - Focusing primarily on hands-on exercises with minimal presentation
  - Creating separate plans for each learning path
- **Impact**:
  - More effective learning experience for participants across different learning paths
  - Better balance between theoretical knowledge and practical application
  - Flexibility to adapt to different learning styles and needs
  - Consistent approach that maintains the course's pharmacy/medication theme
