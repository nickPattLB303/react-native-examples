- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps for animations
- **Bundle Size**: Optimize for minimal size
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management to prevent leaks

### Accessibility Requirements

- **Screen Reader Support**: All components must work with VoiceOver and TalkBack
- **Color Contrast**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for keyboard-only navigation
- **Text Scaling**: Support for dynamic text sizes

## Architecture

### Component Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture with:

- **Atomic Design Principles**: Breaking UI into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages
- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separating logic from presentation
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulating reusable logic

### State Management

- **Local State**: Using React's useState for component-specific state
- **Context API**: For sharing state between related components
- **Redux**: For complex application-wide state management
- **Persistence**: Using AsyncStorage for local data persistence

### Navigation

- **React Navigation**: For handling navigation between screens
- **Stack Navigation**: For hierarchical navigation
- **Tab Navigation**: For switching between main sections
- **Drawer Navigation**: For accessing less frequently used screens

### API Integration

- **RESTful APIs**: Using Fetch or Axios for HTTP requests
- **GraphQL**: Using Apollo Client for GraphQL integration
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication
- **Offline Support**: Implementing caching and offline-first strategies

## Technical Depth

The course covers technical concepts at three levels:

### Surface Level
