# Project Brief: React Native Training Course

## Project Overview

The React Native Training Course is a comprehensive educational program designed to teach developers how to build cross-platform mobile applications using React Native. The course is structured to accommodate learners at different skill levels and follows a consistent pharmacy/medication theme throughout all examples and exercises.

## Project Goals

1. **Provide Comprehensive Training**: Deliver a complete React Native curriculum covering fundamentals through advanced topics
2. **Support Multiple Learning Paths**: Accommodate beginners, intermediate, and advanced learners
3. **Emphasize Practical Application**: Focus on hands-on exercises and real-world scenarios
4. **Ensure Technical Depth**: Go beyond surface-level API usage to explain "under the hood" concepts
5. **Maintain Consistent Theme**: Use pharmacy/medication context throughout all examples
6. **Enable Self-Paced Learning**: Structure content to support both instructor-led and self-paced learning
7. **Ensure Accessibility**: Make content accessible to all learners regardless of background or learning style

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Software developers with JavaScript/React experience looking to build mobile applications
- **Secondary**: Web developers transitioning to mobile development
- **Tertiary**: Computer science students and coding bootcamp participants

## Key Features

1. **Modular Curriculum**: Eight core modules covering all aspects of React Native development
2. **Multi-Path Learning**: Three distinct learning paths for different skill levels
3. **Hands-On Exercises**: Practical exercises at the end of each section
4. **Comprehensive Challenges**: Larger projects at the end of each module
5. **Capstone Project**: Final project integrating all course concepts
6. **Interactive Tools**: Integration with CodePen, Expo Snack, Microsoft Forms, and Microsoft Whiteboard
7. **Collaborative Learning**: Webex integration for discussions and collaboration
8. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive QA process for all content

## Technical Requirements

- **Development Environment**: Expo Go setup for simplified development
- **External Tools**: CodePen, Expo Snack, Microsoft Forms, Microsoft Whiteboard
- **Communication Platform**: Webex for discussions and collaboration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation following Microsoft Writing Style Guide
- **Code Standards**: Consistent coding standards with JSDoc documentation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all content

## Project Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Content planning and structure development
2. **Phase 2**: Module 1-4 development
3. **Phase 3**: Module 5-8 development
4. **Phase 4**: Quality assurance and refinement
5. **Phase 5**: Deployment and initial feedback
6. **Phase 6**: Iterative improvements based on feedback

## Success Criteria

1. **Learner Outcomes**: Participants can build and deploy React Native applications
2. **Completion Rate**: High percentage of learners complete the entire course
3. **Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from learners across all skill levels
4. **Technical Accuracy**: Content remains current with React Native best practices
5. **Accessibility**: Content is accessible to all learners
6. **Scalability**: Course can be expanded with additional modules
