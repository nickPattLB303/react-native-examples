# Module 9: Navigation and Routing

## Overview

This module covers navigation and routing in React Native applications. You'll learn how to implement various navigation patterns, use popular navigation libraries like Expo Router and React Navigation, and create a seamless user experience with proper navigation flows. By the end of this module, you'll be able to build complex navigation structures for your React Native applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of navigation in mobile applications
- Implement navigation using Expo Router
- Implement navigation using React Navigation
- Create and manage navigation stacks, tabs, and drawers
- Handle navigation parameters and deep linking
- Implement authentication flows
- Apply best practices for navigation in React Native
- Create complex navigation patterns
