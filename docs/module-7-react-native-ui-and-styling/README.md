# Module 7: React Native UI and Styling

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Apply core styling principles to React Native components
- Implement responsive layouts using Flexbox
- Create consistent and maintainable component styling
- Use built-in UI components effectively
- Customize and extend React Native components
- Implement platform-specific styling and components
- Apply animations and transitions for enhanced user experience

**Prerequisite Knowledge**: React Essentials (Module 6)
**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours

## Module Overview
This module explores the essential concepts of UI development and styling in React Native. Unlike web development, React Native uses a subset of CSS properties with some unique characteristics. You'll learn how to create visually appealing interfaces that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations while maintaining consistent performance across iOS and Android platforms.

> 💡 **Deep Dive**: React Native's styling system resembles CSS but is implemented in JavaScript. Understanding the nuances of how styles are applied and inherited is crucial for creating maintainable UI code.

## Module Challenge
At the end of this module, you'll complete a challenge that tests your understanding of React Native UI and styling by building a pharmacy medication detail screen with responsive design, custom components, and animations.

> 🔍 **Instructor Note**: This module builds critical UI development skills. Emphasize that good design principles transcend platforms, but implementation details differ significantly between web and React Native.

> 🚀 **Self-Led Learners**: Experiment extensively with the style properties and layout systems. Small adjustments can have significant impacts on the final appearance. Use the React Native debugger to inspect component layout.

> 🔄 **For Web Developers**: Pay special attention to the differences between web CSS and React Native styles. Note the absence of certain properties, the use of JavaScript objects for styles, and performance considerations unique to mobile platforms.

> 🔄 **For Android/iOS Developers**: Compare React Native's styling approach with your native platform's UI framework. For Android developers, relate flexbox to ConstraintLayout. For iOS developers, compare styling patterns to Auto Layout and UIStackView.
