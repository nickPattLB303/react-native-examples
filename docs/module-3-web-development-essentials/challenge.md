# Module 3 Challenge: Medication List Web Page vs. React Native

## Objective
Compare and contrast web development and React Native development by creating both a web version and a React Native version of a simple medication list interface.

**Prerequisite Knowledge**: Module 3 content
**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Focus on identifying the parallels between HTML/CSS and React Native's component/styling system. This exercise is about understanding the conceptual links between web development and React Native.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll build a simple medication list page using HTML and CSS, and then compare how you would approach the same interface in React Native.

The medication list page should include:

1. A header with a pharmacy name and logo
2. A list of medications with the following information for each:
   - Medication name
   - Dosage
   - Instructions
   - Time of next dose
3. A simple form to add a new medication
4. Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile

## Tasks

### 1. HTML/CSS Implementation (CodePen)

Create a CodePen implementation of the medication list page using HTML and CSS.

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement CSS for styling and layout
- Make the design responsive
- Include hover effects for interactive elements

### 2. React Native Component Structure

Create a diagram or written description of how you would structure the same interface in React Native, including:

- Component hierarchy
- Key props for each component
- StyleSheet approach
- Platform-specific considerations

### 3. Comparative Analysis

Complete a Microsoft Form analyzing the differences and similarities between the two approaches:

- How do HTML elements map to React Native components?
- How does CSS styling compare to React Native's StyleSheet?
- What are the advantages and limitations of each approach?
- How would you handle responsiveness in each environment?
- What are the performance considerations for each approach?

## Submission

Submit links to your completed:
1. CodePen implementation
2. Microsoft Whiteboard diagram
3. Microsoft Form analysis

## Evaluation Criteria

Your challenge will be evaluated based on:

- **HTML/CSS Implementation**: Correct use of semantic HTML, clean CSS, and responsive design
- **React Native Structure**: Appropriate component hierarchy and props structure
- **Comparative Analysis**: Depth of understanding of the parallels and differences between approaches
- **Pharmacy Theme**: Appropriate use of the medication/pharmacy context
- **Technical Accuracy**: Correct understanding of both web and React Native concepts
