# Module 3: Web Development Essentials

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the evolution of the web and how it relates to mobile app development
- Explain how browsers render content and execute code
- Create basic HTML documents with proper structure and semantic elements
- Apply fundamental CSS styling to create visually appealing interfaces
- Recognize how web development concepts inform React Native's design philosophy

**Prerequisite Knowledge**: None
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## Module Overview
This module provides essential context about web development to better understand React Native's approach and philosophy. While React Native doesn't directly use HTML and CSS, its component model and styling system are heavily inspired by web development concepts. Understanding these foundations will give you a clearer picture of why React Native works the way it does.

> 💡 **Tip**: Even if you have web development experience, don't skip this module entirely. Pay special attention to the connections between web concepts and React Native's approach, as this will help you understand React Native's design decisions.

1. [A Brief History of the Web](./section-1-web-history/README.md)
2. [How Browsers Work](./section-2-browser-fundamentals/README.md)
3. [HTML Basics](./section-3-html-basics/README.md)
4. [CSS Basics](./section-4-css-basics/README.md)

## Module Challenge
At the end of this module, you'll complete a challenge that tests your understanding of web development essentials by creating a simple medication list page using HTML and CSS and comparing its approach to how you would build the same interface in React Native.

> 🔍 **Instructor Note**: This module provides important context for students without web development experience. For those with web backgrounds, emphasize the connections between web concepts and React Native's approach.

> 🚀 **Self-Led Learners**: The exercises in this module use CodePen for HTML and CSS practice. Be sure to complete them to reinforce your understanding.

> 🔄 **For Android Developers**: HTML elements are conceptually similar to Android XML layouts, while CSS is comparable to styles in Android. Look for these parallels as you work through the module.

> 🔄 **For iOS Developers**: HTML structure is somewhat similar to Interface Builder, while CSS provides styling similar to UIKit appearance properties.
