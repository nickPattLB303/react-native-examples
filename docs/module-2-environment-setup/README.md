# Module 2: Environment Setup

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Configure a professional React Native development environment
- Install and set up the necessary command-line tools
- Create and manage React Native projects using Expo
- Run and test applications on simulators and physical devices
- Navigate and understand the structure of a React Native project
- Understand the development workflow for React Native applications

**Prerequisite Knowledge**: Basic command line familiarity
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

## Module Overview
This module focuses on setting up a professional React Native development environment using Expo. You'll learn to install the necessary tools, create new projects, and run them on both simulators and physical devices. We'll explore the project structure and configuration options to help you understand how a React Native project is organized.

> 💡 **Tip**: If you already have parts of the development environment installed (such as Node.js or Xcode), you can skip those specific steps. However, ensure that you have the correct versions installed for React Native development.

4. [Project Structure and Configuration](./section-4-project-structure-and-configuration/README.md)

## Module Challenge
At the end of this module, you'll complete a challenge that tests your understanding of the React Native development environment by troubleshooting common setup issues and explaining the role of each component in the development workflow.

> 🔍 **Instructor Note**: This module is primarily hands-on setup. Be prepared to help participants troubleshoot environment-specific issues, particularly with XCode installation, Android SDK setup, and environment variables.

> 🚀 **Self-Led Learners**: Create a checklist of each setup step and verify each component is working correctly before proceeding. If you encounter issues, the Expo and React Native documentation have extensive troubleshooting guides.

> 🔄 **For Android/iOS Developers**: While you're likely familiar with the native development environments, React Native introduces some additional tools and configurations. Pay special attention to the JavaScript development environment setup and how it interacts with the native side.
