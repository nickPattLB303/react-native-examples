# Training Session Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for running effective training sessions using the React Native Training Course materials. It offers recommendations for different learning paths and approaches to maximize learning outcomes.

## Training Session Approaches

### 1. Instructor-Led Sessions (End-to-End)

For the full 4-week course with daily instructor-led sessions:

#### Recommended Structure (Daily 1-hour session)
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**
   - Recap previous session
   - Overview of today's topics
   - Learning objectives

2. **Slide Presentation (20-25 minutes)**
   - Present key concepts using the module slides
   - Highlight important points and real-world applications
   - Relate content to the pharmacy/medication theme

3. **Interactive Discussion (10 minutes)**
   - Q&A on presented concepts
   - Clarification of complex topics
   - Real-world examples and applications

4. **Exercise Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Explain the exercise objectives
   - Walk through requirements
   - Provide guidance on approach

5. **Next Steps (5 minutes)**
   - Outline self-directed learning activities
   - Set expectations for the next session
   - Assign any preparation work

#### Self-Directed Component (4-6 hours)
- Completing the exercises introduced in the session
- Reading additional documentation
- Working through code examples
- Collaborating with other participants via Webex

### 2. Self-Led Learning Path

For participants working through the material independently:

#### Recommended Approach
1. **Module Overview**
   - Start with the module README.md to understand learning objectives
   - Review the module slides for a high-level overview
   - Plan your learning schedule based on the estimated times

2. **Section-by-Section Learning**
   - Work through each section's README.md in sequence
   - Review the corresponding slides for visual reinforcement
   - Complete exercises at the end of each section
   - Use the "Self-Led Learners" tips provided in the documentation

3. **Challenge Completion**
   - After completing all sections, attempt the module challenge
   - Use the evaluation criteria to self-assess your work
   - Review solution examples if needed

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Keep track of completed sections and exercises
   - Note any areas that require further study
   - Use the Microsoft Forms for self-assessment

### 3. Async Topic-Specific Learning

For participants needing to learn specific topics on demand:

#### Recommended Approach
1. **Topic Selection**
   - Identify the specific topic needed
   - Locate the relevant module and section in the documentation
   - Review the prerequisites to ensure you have the necessary background

2. **Focused Learning**
   - Read the section README.md for comprehensive information
   - Review the corresponding slides for key points
   - Complete the section exercise to reinforce learning
   - Explore related code examples

3. **Application**
   - Apply the learned concepts to your specific use case
   - Reference the documentation as needed
   - Use the pharmacy theme examples as templates

## Integrating Exercises and Challenges

### Exercise Integration

Exercises should be integrated into the learning flow as follows:

1. **During Instructor-Led Sessions**
   - Introduce the exercise and its objectives
   - Explain how it relates to the concepts covered
   - Provide guidance on approach and expected outcomes
   - Allow time for questions before participants begin self-directed work

2. **For Self-Led Learners**
   - Complete exercises immediately after studying the related section
   - Use the provided resources (CodePen, Expo Snack, etc.)
   - Reference the documentation as needed
   - Check your work against the evaluation criteria

### Challenge Integration

Module challenges should be approached as follows:

1. **During Instructor-Led Sessions**
   - Introduce the challenge at the end of the module
   - Explain the requirements and evaluation criteria
   - Provide guidance on approach and resources
   - Set expectations for completion and review

2. **For Self-Led Learners**
   - Attempt the challenge after completing all module sections
   - Use the Microsoft Forms and Whiteboard tools as directed
   - Self-assess your work using the evaluation criteria
   - Review solution examples if needed

## Using External Tools

The course leverages several external tools that should be integrated into the training sessions:

1. **CodePen**
   - Use for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React exercises
   - Create a collection for participants to share their work
   - Provide starter templates for exercises

2. **Expo Snack**
   - Use for React Native exercises
   - Create shareable links for exercise templates
   - Encourage experimentation with different device previews

3. **Microsoft Forms**
   - Use for analysis exercises and self-assessment
   - Track completion and understanding
   - Provide feedback on responses

4. **Microsoft Whiteboard**
   - Use for diagramming exercises
   - Facilitate collaborative architecture discussions
   - Document design decisions

5. **Webex**
   - Primary communication channel for discussions
   - Host collaborative sessions
   - Share screens for code reviews and demonstrations

## Adapting to Different Audiences

### For Android Developers
- Emphasize the bridge between Android concepts and React Native
- Focus on how React Native interfaces with native Android components
- Highlight similarities and differences in development approaches

### For iOS Developers
- Draw parallels between iOS development and React Native
- Explain how React Native leverages native iOS components
- Compare Swift/Objective-C patterns with React/JavaScript patterns

### For Web Developers
- Build on existing JavaScript and React knowledge
- Focus on mobile-specific considerations
- Emphasize the differences between web and mobile development

## Maintaining the Pharmacy Theme

Throughout all training sessions, maintain the consistent pharmacy/medication theme:

1. **Relate Concepts to Real-World Applications**
   - Connect React Native features to pharmacy app use cases
   - Discuss how concepts apply to medication management
   - Use healthcare examples to illustrate technical points

2. **Contextualize Exercises**
   - Frame exercises within the pharmacy application context
   - Use medication-related data in examples
   - Discuss healthcare considerations in design decisions

3. **Build Towards the Capstone Project**
   - Show how each module contributes to the final pharmacy application
   - Highlight how features will integrate in the complete app
   - Discuss healthcare-specific requirements and considerations

## Conclusion

These guidelines provide a flexible framework for running effective training sessions using the React Native Training Course materials. By adapting the approach to different learning paths and audience needs, instructors and self-led learners can maximize the value of the course content while maintaining a consistent focus on the pharmacy/medication theme.
