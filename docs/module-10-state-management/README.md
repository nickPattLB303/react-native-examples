# Module 10: State Management

## Overview

This module covers state management in React Native applications. You'll learn how to manage application state using various approaches and libraries, from local component state to global state management solutions. By the end of this module, you'll be able to implement efficient and scalable state management strategies for your React Native applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand different types of state in React Native applications
- Implement local state management using React hooks
- Use React Query for server state management
- Implement client state management with Zustand
- Use Context API for shared state
- Implement data persistence with various storage options
- Apply best practices for state management
- Choose the appropriate state management solution for different scenarios
