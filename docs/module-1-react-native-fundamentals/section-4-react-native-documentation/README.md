**Prerequisite Knowledge**: None
**Estimated Time**: 20-30 minutes

## Introduction

> 💡 **Tip**: Being able to find stuff in the docs is super valuable - even the React Native team checks the docs regularly! For the scavenger hunt exercise, focus more on figuring out good search strategies than finding every answer quickly. Knowing how to look things up will save you tons of time down the road.

The official React Native documentation at [reactnative.dev](https://reactnative.dev/) is your primary resource for learning and reference. It's comprehensive, well-maintained, and regularly updated with the latest information.

### Documentation Structure

The React Native documentation is organized into several key sections:

#### 1. Getting Started

This section provides installation instructions and basic setup for React Native development. It covers:
- Environment setup for iOS and Android
- Creating a new application
- Running your app on a device or simulator
- Modifying your app

> 🚀 **Quick Start**: If you're already familiar with mobile development, you can skip directly to the "Learn the Basics" section after setting up your environment.

#### 2. Core Concepts and Components

These sections cover the fundamental building blocks of React Native applications:

**Core Components:**
- View
- Text
- Image
- ScrollView
- TextInput
- And many more

**APIs:**
- StyleSheet
- Animated
- Platform
- AppState
- And many more

```javascript
// Example from the documentation showing core components
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Image, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const MedicationDetail = ({ medication }) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image source={{ uri: medication.imageUrl }} style={styles.image} />
      <View style={styles.details}>
        <Text style={styles.name}>{medication.name}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.dosage}>{medication.dosage}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.instructions}>{medication.instructions}</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
    padding: 16,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#eee',
  },
  // ...other styles
});
```

> 💡 **Deep Dive**: Each component and API documentation page includes not just usage examples, but also props tables, platform compatibility information, and often performance considerations. Take time to read these details as they can help you avoid common pitfalls.

#### 3. Guides

The Guides section provides in-depth explanations of important concepts and techniques:
- Handling user interaction
- Navigation between screens
- Networking and API calls
- Accessibility
- Performance optimization
- Testing and debugging

> 🔄 **For Android Developers**: The "Native Modules" guide will be particularly useful as it explains how to bridge between JavaScript and Java/Kotlin code, similar to JNI in native Android development.

> 🔄 **For iOS Developers**: The "Native Components" guide shows how to create custom UI components that bridge to UIKit, similar to how you might create custom UIView subclasses.

#### 4. Architecture

This section explains how React Native works under the hood:
- Bridge concept
- JavaScript runtime
- Native modules
- The new architecture (Fabric, TurboModules, etc.)

#### 5. API Reference

The API Reference provides detailed documentation for all built-in components, APIs, and modules:
- Complete props lists for components
- Method signatures and return values
- Platform compatibility information
- Usage examples

> 🔍 **Instructor Note**: Emphasize that the API Reference should be the first place students look when they have questions about a specific component or API.

## How to Use the Documentation Effectively

### 1. Start with the Guided Tour

If you're new to React Native, follow the "Getting Started" and "Learn the Basics" sections sequentially. These provide a structured introduction to the framework.

### 2. Use the Search Function

The documentation includes a powerful search feature that can help you quickly find information on specific components, APIs, or concepts.

### 3. Check Platform Compatibility

Many components and APIs have platform-specific behavior or limitations. Always check the "Platform Compatibility" section on documentation pages.

```javascript
// Example of platform-specific code from the documentation
import { Platform, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: {
        shadowColor: 'black',
        shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
        shadowOpacity: 0.2,
        shadowRadius: 4,
      },
      android: {
        elevation: 4,
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### 4. Explore the Examples

Many documentation pages include interactive examples that you can modify and experiment with. These are invaluable for understanding how components and APIs work in practice.

### 5. Check the Version

React Native is actively developed, and APIs can change between versions. Always check which version of React Native the documentation applies to, especially when following tutorials or examples.

> 💡 **Deep Dive**: The React Native documentation is itself an open-source project. If you find errors or areas that could be improved, you can contribute by submitting pull requests to the [documentation repository](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website).

## Beyond the Official Documentation

While the official documentation is comprehensive, there are many other valuable resources in the React Native ecosystem:

### 1. Expo Documentation

If you're using Expo (as we are in this course), the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) is an essential companion to the React Native docs. It covers:
- Expo SDK features
- Workflow tools
- Publishing and building
- Expo-specific APIs

### 2. React Navigation

[React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) is the most popular navigation library for React Native. Its documentation is excellent and covers all aspects of navigation in React Native apps.

### 3. Community Resources

- [React Native Community](https://github.com/react-native-community): GitHub organization with many widely-used packages
- [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/): Searchable database of React Native libraries
- [Awesome React Native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native): Curated list of resources and libraries

### 4. Forums and Discussion

- [React Native GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/discussions)
- [Reactiflux Discord](https://www.reactiflux.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native)

> 🚀 **Self-Led Learners**: Join the Reactiflux Discord community to connect with other React Native developers. It's an excellent place to ask questions and get help when you're stuck.

## Documentation-Driven Development

A powerful approach to learning React Native is "documentation-driven development":

1. **Start with the docs**: Before implementing a feature, read the relevant documentation thoroughly
2. **Experiment with examples**: Try out the examples from the documentation
3. **Adapt to your needs**: Modify the examples to fit your specific requirements
4. **Refer back as needed**: Keep the documentation open as you implement your solution

This approach helps you build a solid understanding of React Native concepts while creating practical implementations.

## Exercise: Documentation Scavenger Hunt

In this exercise, you will practice finding specific information in the React Native documentation that will be essential for building mobile healthcare applications.

### Objective
Develop effective documentation search strategies to quickly locate specific React Native features and APIs needed for pharmacy app development.

### Steps
1. Find the props for the `Image` component that handle loading states and placeholders
2. Locate information about how to implement deep linking in a React Native app
3. Find the API for accessing device information like OS version and device model
4. Discover how to implement pull-to-refresh in a `FlatList`
5. Find information about optimizing JavaScript bundle size for better app performance

For each task, use a different search strategy:
- Try the built-in documentation search
- Navigate through documentation sections
- Use Google with site-specific search (site:reactnative.dev)
- Check GitHub issues for edge cases

### Application
This exercise simulates real-world development scenarios where you need to quickly find solutions in the documentation. These documentation skills will be directly applicable when building our pharmacy app, where you'll need to implement medication image loading with proper states, create deep links for prescription refill notifications, adapt the UI based on the user's device, build a refreshable medication list, and optimize performance for a large medication database.
