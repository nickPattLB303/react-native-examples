# Module 1: React Native Fundamentals - Articulate Conversion Notes

> This document provides guidance for implementing Module 1 in Articulate 360.
> Reference the main [Articulate Integration Guide](../articulate-integration.md) for general workflows.

## Key Visuals

- **React Native Architecture Diagram**: Will need simplification for Articulate slides
- **Environment Setup Screenshots**: Consider creating a separate downloadable guide
- **Component Hierarchy Visualization**: Break into smaller parts for progressive building

## Interactive Opportunities

- **Environment Setup Checklist**: Convert to interactive checklist with hints
- **First Component Exercise**: Could use drag-and-drop code assembly
- **Concept Quiz**: Use standard Articulate knowledge check

## Potential Challenges

- **Environment Setup Instructions**: Too technical for direct conversion
  - Solution: Create a separate downloadable PDF with detailed instructions

- **Code Examples**: First code examples need careful explanation for beginners
  - Solution: Use progressive build with annotations for each new concept

- **Platform Differences**: iOS vs Android differences need clear explanation
  - Solution: Create comparison tables with screenshots of both platforms

## Pharmacy Theme Applications

For Module 1, these are the key pharmacy theme elements to maintain:

- First app should be a "Medication Information Display"
- Sample data should use medication names and dosages
- Examples should focus on pharmaceutical use cases
- Terminology should consistently use pharmacy terms

## Essential Assets

| Asset | Source Location | Purpose |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| react-native-architecture.svg | docs/assets/diagrams/ | Explain RN architecture |
| expo-workflow.png | docs/assets/images/ | Show development flow |
| environment-setup-screenshot.png | docs/assets/images/ | Show terminal output |

## Implementation Priorities

When converting this module to Articulate:

1. Focus on conceptual understanding over technical details
2. Provide downloadable companion guide for environment setup
3. Create separate slides for iOS and Android examples
4. Use more visuals and fewer text blocks than the repository version
5. Add "Try It Yourself" links to Expo Snack for each major concept
