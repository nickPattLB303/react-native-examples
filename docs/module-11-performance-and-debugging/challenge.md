# Module 11 Challenge: Performance Optimization for a Medication List

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you will focus on optimizing the performance of a single key component in a medication tracking application—specifically, a medication list component that displays multiple medication items.

**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Prerequisite Knowledge**: All sections of Module 11

## Learning Objectives
This challenge will test your ability to:
- Identify performance bottlenecks in a React Native component
- Apply optimization techniques to improve rendering performance
- Use appropriate performance measurement tools
- Implement debugging strategies to fix performance issues

## Challenge Description

### Context
MedTracker is a medication tracking application that helps users manage their medications. The application has a key feature—a medication list that displays all the user's medications. This component is experiencing performance issues, especially when scrolling through a large number of medications.

### Requirements

Your task is to identify and fix performance issues in the medication list component:

1. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Use React DevTools or Flipper to identify the performance bottlenecks
   - Analyze render performance of the medication list
   - Document the issues you find

2. **Optimization Implementation**:
   - Optimize the component rendering using appropriate techniques
   - Implement at least two of the following optimizations:
     - React.memo for functional components
     - List virtualization (FlatList optimization)
     - Proper use of useCallback and useMemo
     - Optimized state management

3. **Verification**:
   - Measure the performance before and after optimization
   - Document the improvements

### Technical Requirements

1. Use React DevTools or Flipper for performance analysis
2. Implement proper performance optimizations
3. Document your optimization process and results

## Getting Started

1. Clone the starter project containing a medication list with performance issues
2. Set up your development environment with performance tools
3. Run the application and analyze the medication list performance
4. Implement optimizations to fix the identified issues
5. Measure and document the performance improvements

## Hints and Tips

- Focus on the medication list component rather than the entire application
- Measure before and after each optimization to see the impact
- Look for unnecessary re-renders, heavy computations, and inefficient list rendering
- Remember that premature optimization can lead to complex code without benefits—identify real issues first

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on:

1. **Analysis**: Did you correctly identify the performance bottlenecks?
2. **Implementation**: Did you apply appropriate optimization techniques?
3. **Results**: Did your optimizations improve the performance?
4. **Documentation**: Did you document your process and results clearly?
5. **Code Quality**: Is your optimized code clean and maintainable?

## Submission Guidelines

Submit your solution as:
1. The optimized medication list component code
2. A performance analysis document that includes:
   - Initial performance measurements
   - Identified issues
   - Applied optimizations
   - Final performance measurements
3. Screenshots or recordings showing performance before and after optimization
