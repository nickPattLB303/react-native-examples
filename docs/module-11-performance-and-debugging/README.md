# Module 11: Performance and Debugging

## Overview

This module covers essential techniques for optimizing performance and debugging React Native applications. You'll learn how to identify and fix performance bottlenecks, use various debugging tools, and implement strategies for maintaining high-performing applications. By the end of this module, you'll be able to build React Native applications that are both performant and easy to debug.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand key performance metrics and bottlenecks in React Native
- Measure and analyze performance using various tools
- Implement performance optimizations for React Native applications
- Set up a debugging environment for React Native
- Use built-in and third-party debugging tools
- Debug JavaScript and native code
- Implement error handling and reporting
- Apply advanced debugging techniques for complex issues
- Create a comprehensive performance and debugging strategy
