# Webex Learning Paths Integration Guide

> Module: Cross-Module Resource  
> Estimated time: N/A - Instructor Resource

## Overview

This guide outlines strategies for using the Webex chat channel to support the three distinct learning paths in the React Native Training Course: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. It provides recommendations for instructors to facilitate discussions and activities that are appropriately tailored to each participant's experience level.

## Learning Path Identification

### Initial Assessment

1. **Welcome Survey**: Create a welcome survey in the #general channel that helps identify participants' experience levels:

```
ðŸ“‹ WELCOME SURVEY: Learning Path Assessment

Please react to this message with your experience level:
ðŸŸ¢ - Beginner: New to React Native or React (< 6 months experience)
ðŸŸ¡ - Intermediate: Some React/React Native experience (6 months to 2 years)
ðŸŸ£ - Advanced: Experienced with React Native (2+ years)

Then, in a thread, please share:
1. Your primary goals for this training
2. Specific topics you're most interested in
3. Any particular challenges you're facing with React Native
```

2. **Knowledge Baseline Check**: Post a quick knowledge check in #general to verify learning paths:

```
ðŸ§  QUICK KNOWLEDGE CHECK:

Please answer these questions in a thread to help us tailor the training:

1. Have you built a complete React Native app before? (Yes/No)
2. Are you comfortable with JavaScript ES6 features? (Yes/No/Somewhat)
3. Have you used hooks in React/React Native? (Yes/No/What are hooks?)
4. Have you published an app to app stores? (Yes/No)
5. What's your experience with state management libraries? (None/Redux/MobX/Context API/Other)
```

### Learning Path Indicators

Create visual indicators for learning paths in Webex:

1. **Channel Tags**: Ask participants to include their learning path in their Webex display name:
   - [B] for Beginner
   - [I] for Intermediate
   - [A] for Advanced

2. **Thread Organization**: Use consistent emoji indicators for content targeting specific levels:
   - ðŸŸ¢ Beginner content
   - ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate content
   - ðŸŸ£ Advanced content
   - âšª All levels

## Path-Specific Support Strategies

## Instructor Guidance for Path Management

### Managing Multi-Path Discussions

Strategies for instructors facilitating discussions across different learning paths:

1. **Layered Explanations Technique**:
   - Begin with beginner-friendly foundation
   - Build to intermediate concepts
   - Conclude with advanced considerations
   - Label which parts target which audiences

2. **Targeted Follow-ups**:
   - Direct specific follow-up questions to appropriate learning paths
   - Create separate threads for diving deeper with advanced participants
   - Provide additional resources for beginners
   - Suggest intermediate applications of concepts

3. **Balanced Engagement**:
   - Monitor participation across learning paths
   - Actively draw in underrepresented path participants
   - Pair questions with appropriate-level answerers
   - Periodically check in with quiet participants from each path

### Identifying Path Transitions

Signs that participants may be ready to transition between learning paths:

1. **Beginner to Intermediate**:
   - Answers basic questions confidently
   - Implements solutions without step-by-step guidance
   - Asks questions about optimization and best practices
   - Shows curiosity about "why" beyond "how"

2. **Intermediate to Advanced**:
   - Provides nuanced answers to complex questions
   - Discusses trade-offs between different approaches
   - Identifies performance considerations proactively
   - Mentors beginners effectively
   - Contributes architectural insights
