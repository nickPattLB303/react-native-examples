# Webex Chat Participation Guide

> Module: Cross-Module Resource  
> Estimated time: 10 minutes

## Welcome to the React Native Training Webex Community!

This guide will help you make the most of our Webex chat channels during the React Native Training Course. The Webex workspace serves as our collaborative hub for questions, discussions, code sharing, and community support.

## Getting Started

### Channel Navigation

Our Webex workspace includes these dedicated channels:

| Channel | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| #announcements | Course-wide announcements | Check daily for important updates |
| #general | Community discussions and casual conversation | General questions and networking |
| #module1 | React Native Fundamentals discussions | Questions specific to Module 1 |
| #module2 | Components and Props discussions | Questions specific to Module 2 |
| #module3 | State Management discussions | Questions specific to Module 3 |
| #challenges | Coding challenge submissions and feedback | Sharing your solutions and reviewing others |
| #resources | Useful links and tools | Finding and sharing helpful resources |
| #help-desk | Technical issues and urgent help | When you're blocked on technical setup |

### Setting Up Your Profile

To help build our learning community:

1. **Profile Picture**: Add a professional photo to make interactions more personal
2. **Profile Bio**: Include your role, experience level, and learning goals
3. **Notifications**: Configure your notification settings to ensure you don't miss important discussions
4. **Status**: Use status indicators when you're actively working on exercises or need assistance

## Communication Best Practices

### Asking Effective Questions

Follow this format for code-related questions to get the fastest, most helpful responses:

```
[MODULE 2.3] Component Props Question

My code:
```jsx
const MedicationItem = ({ medication }) => {
  // Code with issue
}
```

Expected behavior: Medication name should display in bold
Actual behavior: Getting undefined error

Things I've tried:
- Checked that medication prop is being passed
- Verified object structure in console.log
```

### Using Threads

Threads help keep discussions organized:

- Use threads for follow-up questions on the same topic
- Keep code discussions contained in a single thread
- Check existing threads before posting a new question
- Subscribe to threads relevant to your current challenges

### Collaborative Etiquette

- **Be Specific**: Clear, focused questions get better answers
- **Show Your Work**: Share what you've tried before asking for help
- **Help Others**: Answer questions where you can, even partially
- **Follow Up**: Mark resolved issues with a ‚úÖ and share what fixed it
- **Be Patient**: Allow time for responses, especially for complex questions
- **Stay On-Topic**: Keep conversations relevant to the channel's purpose

## Pharmacy-Themed Learning Community

As part of our course theme, we encourage:

- Using pharmacy/medication terminology in example code
- Relating React Native concepts to pharmacy workflows
- Thinking about how your solutions would work in a pharmacy application
- Considering pharmaceutical use cases when designing components

## Code Sharing Guidelines

### Formatting Code

When sharing code in Webex:

1. Use triple backticks with language specification:
   ````
   ```jsx
   // Your code here
   ```
   ````

2. For longer code samples, use:
   - GitHub Gists
   - Expo Snacks
   - CodeSandbox links

### Code Reviews

When participating in peer code reviews:

1. Be constructive and specific in feedback
2. Comment on at least two positive aspects
3. Suggest improvements rather than criticizing
4. Focus on both functionality and pharmacy theming
5. Use the standard code review format:

```
Review for @username's Medication List Component:

üí™ Strengths:
- Clean component structure
- Good use of pharmacy terminology in variable names

üí≠ Suggestions:
- Consider destructuring props in parameter list
- Could add error handling for missing medication data

‚ùì Questions:
- How would you handle expired medications in this UI?
```

## Learning Together

### Daily Participation

For maximum learning benefit:

- **Morning Check-in**: Review announcements and prepare for the day
- **Active Questioning**: Ask at least one thoughtful question per module
- **Helping Peers**: Respond to at least one question from fellow participants
- **End-of-Day Reflection**: Share one key insight or challenge from the day
- **Resource Sharing**: Contribute helpful resources you discover

### Collaborative Exercises

Many exercises will have a collaborative component:

- Pair programming through Webex
- Small group problem-solving in threads
- Code review exchanges
- Knowledge sharing challenges

### Learning Accountability

Use Webex to enhance your accountability:

- Share your daily goals in #general
- Post completion updates on exercises
- Request specific feedback on areas you're focusing on
- Document your learning journey for self-reflection

## Connecting with Repository and Articulate

### Repository Integration

- Reference specific file paths when discussing repository content
- Use standardized format for reporting documentation issues
- Link directly to code examples when asking questions

### Articulate Connection

- Share insights from Articulate modules in relevant channels
- Post discussion responses to prompts from the e-learning materials
- Link knowledge check answers to Webex discussions for deeper exploration

## Getting Help

### For Technical Issues

If you encounter technical problems:

1. Check pinned messages in #help-desk for common solutions
2. Search channel history for similar issues
3. Use the help request template in #help-desk
4. Be prepared to share error messages and environment details

### For Content Questions

If you need clarification on course content:

1. Check the appropriate module channel for existing discussions
2. Reference specific section/slide numbers in your question
3. Share your current understanding and what's unclear
4. Include any relevant code examples

## Templates
