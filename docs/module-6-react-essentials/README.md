# Module 6: React Essentials

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of React including components, props, and state
- Implement functional components with React Hooks
- Explain the React component lifecycle and how it differs from class components
- Apply JSX syntax effectively in React applications
- Create reusable and composable components
- Manage component state and side effects using hooks

**Prerequisite Knowledge**: JavaScript Essentials (Module 4), TypeScript Essentials (Module 5)
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

## Module Overview
This module introduces the fundamental concepts of React, the JavaScript library upon which React Native is built. While React Native extends React for mobile development, mastering React's core concepts is essential for building effective React Native applications. We'll focus on modern React patterns using functional components and hooks rather than class-based approaches.

> 💡 **Deep Dive**: React's component model forms the foundation of React Native. Understanding how data flows through components, how state is managed, and how the rendering lifecycle works will make you far more effective in troubleshooting and optimizing React Native apps.

1. [Introduction to React](./section-1-introduction-to-react/README.md)
2. [Components and JSX](./section-2-components-and-jsx/README.md)
3. [Props and Component Composition](./section-3-props-and-component-composition/README.md)
4. [State and Hooks](./section-4-state-and-hooks/README.md)
5. [Component Lifecycle and Effects](./section-5-component-lifecycle-and-effects/README.md)

## Module Challenge
At the end of this module, you'll complete a challenge that tests your understanding of React fundamentals by building a medication tracking component with multiple child components, state management, and side effects.

> 🔍 **Instructor Note**: This module builds the conceptual foundation for the rest of the course. Emphasize how React's concepts are directly applied in React Native, just with different primitive components.

> 🚀 **Self-Led Learners**: Take time to experiment with the code examples provided in each section. Try modifying them to reinforce your understanding before moving on to the next section.

> 🔄 **For Web Developers**: If you're already familiar with React for web development, focus on understanding how the component lifecycle and state management patterns translate to mobile contexts. Pay attention to performance considerations that are different on mobile.

> 🔄 **For Android/iOS Developers**: Focus on understanding how React's component model compares to the UI framework you're familiar with. For Android developers, compare it to Views and ViewGroups. For iOS developers, compare it to UIViews and ViewControllers.
