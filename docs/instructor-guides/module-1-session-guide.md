const MedicationComponent = () => {
  // We'll build this together
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Medication Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MedicationComponent;
```

*Live coding steps:*

const MedicationComponent = ({ medication }) => {
  const { name, dosage, instructions, isHighPriority } = medication;
  
  return (
    <View style={[styles.container, isHighPriority && styles.highPriority]}>
      <Text style={styles.medicationName}>{name}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.dosage}>{dosage}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.instructions}>{instructions}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 16,
    marginVertical: 8,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    borderRadius: 8,
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOpacity: 0.1,
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowRadius: 4,
    elevation: 2,
  },
  highPriority: {
    borderLeftWidth: 4,
    borderLeftColor: '#c00',
  },
  medicationName: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 4,
    color: '#0052cc',
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: {
        fontFamily: 'Helvetica Neue',
      },
      android: {
        fontFamily: 'Roboto',
      },
    }),
  },

## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions and Answers

1. **Q: "How does React Native's performance compare to fully native apps?"**
   A: "React Native approaches native performance for most UI interactions because it renders using native components. The JavaScript bridge can introduce some overhead for complex interactions or animations. For pharmacy apps handling standard UI and data display, performance differences are typically minimal. Areas requiring intense computation might benefit from native modules."

2. **Q: "Do I need to learn Swift/Kotlin to use React Native effectively?"**
   A: "For most pharmacy application features, you won't need Swift or Kotlin. However, understanding basic native concepts can help when debugging or when you need to extend React Native with custom native modules. We recommend focusing on JavaScript/React fundamentals first, then exploring native code as needed for specific requirements."

3. **Q: "How do I handle offline capabilities for a pharmacy app?"**
   A: "Offline capabilities are crucial for pharmacy apps, especially in clinical settings with potential connectivity issues. React Native offers several approaches: AsyncStorage for simple data, SQLite for structured storage, or libraries like WatermelonDB for more complex offline-first architectures. We'll cover offline strategies in detail in Module 5."

4. **Q: "What's the best way to organize styles in a large React Native project?"**
   A: "For pharmacy apps with consistent design language, we recommend: 1) A theme file with colors, spacing, and typography, 2) Component-specific StyleSheet objects, 3) Shared style utilities for common patterns, and 4) Consider style libraries like styled-components for more complex theming. This maintains the medication/pharmacy theme consistently across the application."

### Challenge Question Strategies

*For deeper technical questions:*
- Acknowledge complexity
- Provide concise answer for current context
- Offer to explore in depth during breaks
- Connect to relevant module later in course

*For out-of-scope questions:*
- Validate the importance of the question
- Briefly explain how it relates to the current topic
- Note when/if it will be covered later
- Offer resources for self-exploration

### Handling Unknown Questions

*When you don't know the answer:*
1. Acknowledge the good question
2. Be honest about not having an immediate answer
3. Suggest exploration approach: "Let's think about how we might solve this..."
4. Commit to researching and following up: "I'll research this during break and get back to you..."
5. Consider if another participant might have insight to share

## Session Closure
