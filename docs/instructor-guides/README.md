# Instructor Session Guides

This directory contains comprehensive guides for instructors delivering the React Native Training Course. These guides ensure consistent, high-quality instruction across all modules while accommodating different learning paths and participant needs.

## Purpose

Instructor Session Guides serve as detailed "playbooks" for delivering effective training sessions. They go beyond the slide content to include:

- Comprehensive preparation checklists
- Detailed teaching notes for each slide
- Instructions for demonstrations and exercises
- Tips for handling questions and challenges
- Strategies for engaging participants at different experience levels
- Integration points with Webex and Articulate content

## Guide Structure

Each module has a dedicated instructor guide that follows a consistent structure:

1. **Session Preparation Checklist**: Technical setup, content customization, and material distribution
2. **Session Blueprint**: Detailed timeline with teaching notes for each section
3. **Learning Path Adaptations**: Specific guidance for supporting beginner, intermediate, and advanced learners
4. **Demonstration Plan**: Step-by-step instructions for live demonstrations
5. **Exercise Facilitation Guide**: Setup, requirements, and facilitation strategies
6. **Q&A Preparation**: Anticipated questions and response strategies
7. **Webex Integration**: Pre-session, in-session, and post-session activities
8. **Articulate Integration**: Connections between instructor-led content and Articulate modules
9. **Continuous Improvement Notes**: Space for feedback and refinement

## Available Guides

### Module-Specific Guides
- [Module 1: React Native Fundamentals](./module-1-session-guide.md)
- [Module 2: Components and Props](./module-2-session-guide.md) (Coming soon)
- [Module 3: State Management](./module-3-session-guide.md) (Coming soon)

### Supplementary Guides
- [React Native Marketing and Positioning Guide](./react-native-marketing-guide.md) - Essential strategies for generating developer buy-in and enthusiasm

## Using the Template

To create a new instructor guide:

1. Copy the [Instructor Guide Template](./instructor-guide-template.md)
2. Rename following the convention: `module-X-session-guide.md`
3. Fill in all sections with module-specific content
4. Ensure slide references are accurate and up-to-date
5. Include detailed notes for all demonstrations and exercises
6. Add pharmacy-themed examples and connections

## Pharmacy Theme Integration

Consistent with course standards, instructor guides should:

- Use the ðŸ’Š emoji to highlight pharmacy-themed connections
- Include pharmacy-relevant analogies for technical concepts
- Frame demonstrations and exercises in pharmacy contexts
- Prepare answers to questions using pharmacy examples

## Marketing and Positioning React Native

A critical aspect of the training is not just teaching React Native, but also convincing participants of its value. The [React Native Marketing and Positioning Guide](./react-native-marketing-guide.md) provides:

- Opening day strategies to establish buy-in
- Response frameworks for handling skeptical questions
- Module-specific positioning themes and "wow moments"
- Concrete examples comparing React Native to native development
- Pharmacy-specific selling points
- Measurement techniques to track marketing effectiveness

Remember to integrate marketing points throughout your delivery, not just as separate sections. Every technical concept should connect to a value proposition.

## Formatting Standards

For consistent formatting across all guides:

- Use [time] notation for all activities (e.g., [15 min])
- Use [Slides X-Y] notation for slide references
- Use blockquotes (`>`) for suggested verbatim script elements
- Use italic text (`*text*`) for notes that are for instructor eyes only
- Use the ðŸ‘¥ emoji to indicate participant interaction points
- Use ðŸŸ¢ (beginner), ðŸŸ¡ (intermediate), ðŸŸ£ (advanced) emojis for learning path-specific content
- Use ðŸš€ emoji to highlight particularly exciting React Native features

## Continuous Improvement

Instructor guides are living documents that should improve with each delivery:

1. Before each session:
   - Review and update based on previous feedback
   - Check for updated slide references
   - Verify all code examples still work with current repository

2. During each session:
   - Note timing issues for individual sections
   - Mark places where participants struggled
   - Identify questions not covered in Q&A section
   - Track reactions to positioning and marketing points

3. After each session:
   - Update the Continuous Improvement Notes section
   - Adjust timing for sections as needed
   - Add newly discovered questions to Q&A section
   - Share insights with other instructors
   - Document successful marketing approaches

## Webex and Repository Integration

All instructor guides should:

1. Reference specific repository files for demonstrations
2. Include Webex integration points for pre, during, and post-session
3. Provide guidance on transitioning discussions to Webex
4. Highlight connections to Articulate e-learning content
