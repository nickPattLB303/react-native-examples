# Module 7: React Native Components and User Input

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Identify and use core React Native UI components
- Understand the differences between React Native and web components
- Implement form elements and capture user input
- Handle different input types (text, numeric, selection, etc.)
- Validate user input and provide appropriate feedback
- Create accessible forms using React Native
- Implement platform-specific input behaviors when necessary
- Optimize input components for mobile interactions

**Prerequisite Knowledge**: React Essentials (Module 6)
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

## Module Overview
This module focuses on the building blocks of React Native applications - components and user input handling. You'll learn about the core UI components provided by React Native, how they differ from web components, and best practices for implementing forms and capturing user input in a mobile context. Throughout the module, we'll apply these concepts to our medication/pharmacy application by building interfaces for patient information entry, medication search, and order forms.

> 💡 **Tip**: Mobile input differs significantly from web input. Pay close attention to keyboard management, input validation timing, and platform-specific behaviors to create a smooth user experience.

## Module Challenge
At the end of this module, you'll complete a challenge that tests your understanding of React Native components and user input by implementing a medication order form. The form will include various input types, validation, accessibility features, and appropriate keyboard management to create a smooth user experience.

> 🔍 **Instructor Note**: This module bridges the conceptual understanding of React from Module 6 to the practical implementation in React Native. Emphasize the differences between web and mobile input paradigms throughout the sections.

> 🚀 **Self-Led Learners**: Take time to test your input components on actual devices, not just simulators. Real-world testing will help you understand the nuances of mobile input, especially keyboard behavior and touch interactions.

> 🔄 **For Web Developers**: Focus on the differences between HTML form elements and React Native input components. Pay special attention to keyboard management and the mobile-first approach to form design.

> 🔄 **For Android/iOS Developers**: Compare React Native's input components with native equivalents you're familiar with. Note how React Native abstracts platform differences while still allowing for platform-specific customization.
