## Current Focus Areas

1. **Content Alignment**
   - Ensuring consistency between slides and markdown documentation
   - Verifying that all content follows the pharmacy/medication theme
   - Checking that learning objectives are clearly defined and met

2. **Technical Quality**
   - Validating code examples for correctness and best practices
   - Ensuring platform-specific considerations are addressed
   - Verifying that "under the hood" explanations are accurate and helpful

3. **Learning Experience**
   - Testing exercises and challenges with different skill levels
   - Gathering feedback on content clarity and flow
   - Ensuring that all learning paths are properly supported

4. **Tooling and Infrastructure**
   - Improving development workflow
   - Enhancing automated validation
   - Streamlining content creation process

## Recent Changes

- Completed Module 1 slides and documentation
- Established quality assurance process based on lessons learned from Module 1
- Refined module development process for more efficient content creation
- Updated exercise templates to better support different learning paths

## Known Issues

- Some code examples in Module 1 need additional platform-specific explanations
- Exercise resources for diagramming need more detailed instructions
- Navigation between some slide sections needs improvement
- Some deep-level explanations need additional visual aids

## Communication Channels

The course utilizes Webex for team collaboration and communication, following these guidelines:

### Single Channel Management

Initially, the course utilizes a single Webex channel for all communications:

1. **Message Threading**: 
   - Create parent threads for each module/topic
   - Use emoji reactions to categorize questions (🐞 for bugs, 🤔 for conceptual questions)
   - Pin critical threads for easy reference

2. **Topic Tagging System**:
   ```
   [M1] React Native Fundamentals question
   [M2] Component Props issue
   [SETUP] Environment configuration
   [CHALLENGE] Module 1 challenge clarification
   ```

3. **Time-Based Organization**:
   - Morning check-ins with daily goals
   - End-of-day summaries and next-day preparation
   - Scheduled "office hours" for focused Q&A

4. **Search-Optimized Messages**:
   ```
   RESOURCE: React Native Navigation Documentation
   ANNOUNCEMENT: Module 2 Challenge Due Date
   FAQ: Common Props Errors
   ```

### Transitioning to Multiple Channels

As the course progresses, a plan is in place for transitioning to multiple channels:

1. **Channel Growth Plan**:
   ```
   Phase 1: Single channel with tagging (Weeks 1-2)
   Phase 2: Add #resources channel (Week 3)
   Phase 3: Add module-specific channels (Week 4+)
   ```

2. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Announce changes 3-5 days in advance
   - Provide clear instructions for new channel purposes
   - Pin migration announcements in the original channel
   - Cross-post important content during transition period

### Question Handling

Course materials are designed with the Webex channel in mind:

1. **Anticipated Questions**: Each major section includes an "FAQ Preview" with common questions and prepared answers.

2. **Question Routing**: Clear indicators for when questions should be:
   - Answered immediately during sessions
   - Posted to the Webex channel for deeper discussion
   - Researched and answered in a follow-up session

3. **Code Question Protocol**:
   ```
   [Module 2.3] Component Props Question
   
   My code:
   ```jsx
   const MedicationItem = ({ medication }) => {
     // Code with issue
   }
   ```
   
   Expected behavior: Medication name should display in bold
   Actual behavior: Getting undefined error
   ```

### Collaborative Exercises

Exercises are designed with collaboration in mind:

1. **Pair Programming**: Specific pair programming exercises with role assignments:
   - Navigator: Reads instructions and guides implementation
   - Driver: Writes the code
   - Both roles should switch halfway through

2. **Code Reviews**: Peer code review cycles after individual exercises:
   - Post screenshots/snippets to designated Webex threads
   - Provide a code review checklist specific to each exercise
   - Require at least two constructive comments per review

3. **Group Challenges**: Pharmacy-themed challenges for 3-4 person teams:
   - Assign specific roles (UI, data management, navigation)
   - Include Webex coordination checkpoints
   - Provide collaborative workspace links (e.g., Expo Snack team mode)

### Repository-Webex Connections

The repository content is directly connected to Webex communications:

1. **Module-Specific Channels**:
   ```
   #general - Course-wide announcements
   #module1 - React Native Fundamentals questions
   #module2 - Components and Props discussions
   #challenges - All coding challenges
   #resources - Useful links and tools
   ```

2. **GitHub Integration**: Webhook setup between GitHub and Webex:
   - New example code pushes trigger notifications
   - Issue tracking for identified errors in materials
   - Automatic daily summaries of repository updates

### Cross-Platform Knowledge Management

Knowledge is effectively transferred between platforms:

1. **FAQ Collection**: Common Webex questions are compiled into:
   - Repository documentation updates
   - Future Articulate content improvements
   - Reference cheat sheets

2. **Exemplary Solutions**: Process for elevating excellent work:
   - Participant permission workflow
   - Code cleanup and standardization
   - Integration into repository examples
   - Attribution tracking

3. **Feedback Loop**: Structured process for using Webex feedback:
   - Weekly content improvement task based on discussions
   - Categorizing identified documentation gaps
   - Prioritization of clarification topics

## Current Priorities

1. Complete Module 2 development
2. Address known issues in Module 1
3. Enhance automated validation
4. Improve content alignment between slides and markdown
5. Refine exercise resources for better learning outcomes
6. Implement Webex integration for collaborative learning
