# Medication Tracker Exercise - Completed Example

This is the completed implementation of the Medication Tracker exercise that demonstrates TypeScript with React Native.

## Implementation Details

This example demonstrates the following TypeScript concepts in React Native:

1. **Type Definitions with Interfaces**
   - `Medication` interface defines the structure of medication data
   - `UserSettings` interface defines user preferences
   - `MedicationItemProps` interface types the props for the MedicationItem component

2. **Typed Functional Components**
   - `MedicationItem` is typed as `React.FC<MedicationItemProps>`
   - The main `App` component is typed as `React.FC`

3. **Custom Hooks with TypeScript**
   - `useMedications` hook is implemented with TypeScript
   - Return type is explicitly defined with `UseMedicationsResult` interface
   - Leverages TypeScript utility types like `Omit<T, K>`

4. **Type-Safe State Management**
   - `useState<Medication[]>([])` for medication list state
   - `useState<boolean>(true)` for loading state
   - `useState<Error | null>(null)` for error state with union type

5. **Type-Safe Event Handlers**
   - Functions are properly typed with parameter and return types
   - Event callbacks use proper TypeScript typing

6. **Type-Safe Styling**
   - StyleSheet is created with appropriate types

## Running the Example

This example can be run in Expo Snack or in a local Expo environment. 

The app allows you to:
- View a list of medications with their details
- Mark medications as taken
- Skip medications
- Add a new medication (simulated)

## Key TypeScript Features Used

- Generic types with React components
- Union types (`Error | null`)
- Explicit return types for functions
- Array typing with generics
- Interface extension and composition
- Type utility functions (Omit<T, K>)
- Proper typing for React Native components and APIs

## Learning Next Steps

After understanding this example, you could extend it by:
1. Adding a form to add medications with validation
2. Implementing navigation with typed parameters
3. Adding persistent storage with TypeScript
4. Creating more complex state management with useReducer and TypeScript
