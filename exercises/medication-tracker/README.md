# TypeScript with React Native: Medication Tracker Exercise

This exercise demonstrates how to use TypeScript with React Native to create a type-safe medication tracking application. It's designed to help you practice the concepts covered in Module 5, Section 3: TypeScript with React Native.

## Exercise Structure

This exercise contains two directories:

1. **`starter/`**: Contains the starter code that you'll use to complete the exercise. It has the basic structure and TODOs for you to implement.

2. **`complete/`**: Contains the complete implementation with all the TypeScript features properly applied. Use this as a reference or to check your work.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you'll practice:

- Defining TypeScript interfaces for React Native components
- Using TypeScript with React functional components
- Implementing type-safe state management with useState
- Creating custom hooks with TypeScript
- Adding type-safe event handlers
- Properly typing styles

## How to Use This Exercise

### Running on Expo Snack

This exercise is designed to be run on Expo Snack, which allows you to run React Native code in your browser or on your physical device using the Expo Go app.

1. Go to [snack.expo.dev](https://snack.expo.dev/)
2. Create a new TypeScript project
3. Copy the code from either the starter or complete example
4. Run the project in the preview pane

### Development Process

1. Start with the code in the `starter/` directory
2. Follow the TODOs in the code to implement TypeScript features
3. Test your implementation in Expo Snack
4. Compare your solution with the implementation in the `complete/` directory

## Technical Requirements

The application should:

- Display a list of medications with their details
- Allow marking medications as taken
- Allow skipping medications
- Support adding new medications
- Use TypeScript for all components, props, state, and hooks
- Handle loading, error, and empty states
