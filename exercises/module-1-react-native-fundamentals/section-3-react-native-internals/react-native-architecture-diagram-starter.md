# React Native Architecture Diagram Exercise - Starter

## Instructions
Using this starter diagram, complete the React Native architecture flow for a pharmacy app's "Refill Prescription" feature. Add the missing components, connections, and annotations to show the complete data flow from user interaction to UI updates.

## Starter Diagram

    %% User Interaction
    User[User Action:<br/>Tap Refill Button]
    
    %% Main Components
    JS[JavaScript Thread]
    Bridge[Bridge]
    Native[Native Thread]
    
    %% Basic Flow
    User --> JS
    JS --> Bridge
    Bridge --> Native
    
    %% Add your components and connections here
    %% Consider:
    %% - Event handling
    %% - Data processing
    %% - Native modules
    %% - UI updates
    %% - Threading model
    %% - Performance bottlenecks
    
    %% Style definitions

    classDef jsThread fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef bridge fill:#9ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef nativeThread fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    
    %% Apply styles
    class User userAction;
    class JS jsThread;
    class Bridge bridge;
    class Native nativeThread;
```

## Requirements

1. Add the following components:
   - Event handlers in JavaScript
   - Data processing steps
   - Native module interactions
   - UI update process
   - Background operations

2. Show the following flows:
   - Event propagation
   - Data serialization/deserialization
   - Native API calls
   - UI render updates

3. Identify and mark:
   - Potential performance bottlenecks
   - Asynchronous operations
   - Thread interactions
   - Bridge communication points

4. Add annotations for:
   - Performance considerations
   - Threading implications
   - Batch update handling
   - Error scenarios

## Tips
- Use different shapes for different types of operations
- Use colors to distinguish between threads
- Add labels to explain key processes
- Show timing and sequencing with appropriate arrows
- Mark synchronous vs. asynchronous operations
