# React Native Advantages Analysis Exercise

## Instructions for Instructors
This file contains the questions and evaluation criteria for the React Native Advantages Analysis exercise. Use this content to create a Microsoft Form that students will access during the exercise.

## Exercise Overview

### Scenario
You are a technical architect evaluating React Native for a new pharmacy application. The app needs to:
- Display detailed medication information with images
- Allow prescription refills with barcode scanning
- Send medication reminders and notifications
- Work offline in areas with poor connectivity
- Integrate with pharmacy management systems
- Support both iOS and Android platforms

## Part 1: Feature Analysis

### Question 1: Cross-Platform Benefits
**Identify three specific features from the pharmacy app that would benefit most from React Native's cross-platform capabilities. For each feature, explain why React Native is advantageous.**

Example response format:
```
Feature 1: [Feature name]
Benefits:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
Technical rationale: [Explanation]
```

### Question 2: Performance Considerations
**For each of these features, rate the expected performance impact (High/Medium/Low) and explain your reasoning:**

a) Medication list scrolling and search
b) Barcode scanning for refills
c) Offline data synchronization
d) Push notifications for reminders

Example response format:
```
Feature: [Feature name]
Performance Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
Rationale: [Explanation]
React Native Solution: [How React Native addresses this]
```

## Part 2: Development Analysis

### Question 3: Resource Requirements
**Compare the development resources needed for React Native vs. native development approaches:**

a) Team size and composition
b) Development timeline
c) Testing requirements
d) Maintenance considerations

Use this format:
```
Aspect: [Resource aspect]
React Native Approach: [Description]
Native Development Approach: [Description]
Cost/Benefit Analysis: [Comparison]
```

### Question 4: Technical Challenges
**Identify potential technical challenges and propose solutions for:**

a) Offline data management
b) Integration with pharmacy systems
c) Platform-specific UI requirements
d) Performance optimization

Example response format:
```
Challenge: [Description]
Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
Proposed Solution: [Technical approach]
React Native Considerations: [Specific framework considerations]
```

## Part 3: Recommendation

### Question 5: Final Recommendation
**Based on your analysis, provide a recommendation for using React Native for the pharmacy app. Include:**

a) Overall recommendation (Strongly Recommend / Recommend / Not Recommended)
b) Top 3 advantages for this specific use case
c) Top 3 risks or challenges to consider
d) Mitigation strategies for identified risks

Example response format:
```
Recommendation: [Choice]
Key Advantages:
1. [Advantage 1]
2. [Advantage 2]
3. [Advantage 3]

Key Risks:
1. [Risk 1]
2. [Risk 2]
3. [Risk 3]

Mitigation Strategies:
1. [Strategy 1]
2. [Strategy 2]
3. [Strategy 3]
```

## Evaluation Criteria

Responses will be evaluated based on:
1. Understanding of React Native capabilities (25%)
2. Technical depth of analysis (25%)
3. Practical consideration of real-world factors (25%)
4. Quality of argumentation and recommendations (25%)

### Strong responses should:
- Demonstrate understanding of React Native's architecture
- Consider both technical and business factors
- Provide specific, detailed examples
- Show awareness of mobile development challenges
- Include realistic mitigation strategies

### Weak responses typically:
- Focus only on surface-level features
- Ignore business considerations
- Provide vague or general answers
- Miss key technical challenges
- Lack specific examples or solutions

## Additional Notes for Instructors

When creating the Microsoft Form:
- Allow sufficient space for detailed responses
- Include the evaluation criteria for transparency
- Consider adding relevant React Native documentation links
- Include a pharmacy app mockup for reference
- Set a 45-minute time limit for completion
