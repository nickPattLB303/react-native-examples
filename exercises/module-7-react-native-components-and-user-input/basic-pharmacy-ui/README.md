# Basic Pharmacy UI Layout Exercise

This directory contains both the starter and completed versions of the Basic Pharmacy UI Layout exercise from Module 7, Section 1 of the React Native Training Course.

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you will create a basic medicine details screen using React Native core components and TypeScript. The screen will display information about a medication including its name, image, details, description, and an "Add to Cart" button.

## Learning Objectives

- Use core React Native components (View, Text, Image, ScrollView, Pressable) with TypeScript
- Structure a screen layout using appropriate components
- Apply styling to React Native components using StyleSheet
- Implement basic interactivity with state management
- Use TypeScript interfaces and type annotations

## Structure

- `/starter` - Contains the starting point code for the exercise
- `/complete` - Contains the completed implementation for reference

## Running on Expo Snack

Both versions of this exercise are ready to run on Expo Snack. Note that configuration files like package.json and tsconfig.json are deliberately excluded as Expo Snack handles these configurations automatically.

### Option 1: Upload to Expo Snack

1. Go to [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/)
2. Click "Import git repository"
3. Enter the GitHub URL for this repository
4. Navigate to either the `starter` or `complete` directory

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Go to [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/)
2. Create a new Snack with TypeScript
3. Replace the default `App.tsx` file with the content from the `App.tsx` in either the `starter` or `complete` directory
4. Run the Snack on your device using the Expo Go app or in the embedded simulator

### Adding Dependencies in Expo Snack

If your implementation requires additional dependencies:
1. Click the "Dependencies" button in the Expo Snack interface
2. Search for and add any required packages
3. Expo Snack will automatically handle the installation and configuration

## Instructions

Detailed instructions for completing the exercise can be found in the README.md file in the `starter` directory.

## TypeScript

This exercise is implemented in TypeScript to provide type safety and better documentation. Key TypeScript features used:

- Interfaces for defining data structures
- Type annotations for component props and state
- Function return type annotations
- React.FC for functional component typing
