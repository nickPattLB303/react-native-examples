# Medication Input Form Challenge - Complete Solution (TypeScript)

## Overview
This is the complete solution for the Medication Input Form challenge using TypeScript. It implements all the required functionality, including form validation, keyboard handling, and accessibility features, while providing type safety through TypeScript.

## Solution Features

### Functional Features
The solution includes:

1. **Medication Information Section**
   - Text input for medication name with validation
   - Numeric input for medication strength with validation
   - Picker component for medication form selection (tablet, capsule, etc.)

2. **Dosage Instructions Section**
   - Input for dosage amount
   - Picker component for frequency selection
   - Multiline text area for additional instructions

3. **Form Validation**
   - Required field validation for medication name and strength
   - Numeric validation for the strength field
   - Visual error indicators and error messages

4. **User Experience**
   - Keyboard avoiding view for better mobile experience
   - Activity indicator during form submission
   - Disabled submit button when form is invalid
   - Visual feedback for form state

5. **Accessibility**
   - Accessibility labels and hints for all input components
   - Clear visual hierarchy and typography

6. **TypeScript Features**
   - Type-safe form state management
   - Interfaces for form data and validation errors
   - Type-safe event handlers with proper parameter types
   - Type checking for component props

### Implementation Details

#### State Management
The solution uses React's `useState<T>` hook with TypeScript types to manage:
- Form data for all fields (using `MedicationFormData` interface)
- Validation errors (using `FormErrors` interface)
- Form submission state (using boolean types)
- Form validity state (using boolean types)

#### Form Validation
Validation is performed in two ways:
1. Real-time validation using `useEffect` to determine if the form is valid
2. On-submit validation to provide specific error messages

#### Styling
The solution uses a clean, user-friendly design with:
- Clear section headings
- Visual error states
- Responsive layout
- Proper spacing and typography

## Getting Started
This solution is designed to be run in Expo Snack. To run the code:

1. Open [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/)
2. Copy the contents of `App.tsx` into a new Snack
3. Make sure to select TypeScript in the Snack settings
4. You can view the output on the right side of the screen or on your mobile device using the Expo Go app

## Code Structure

The solution is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces and types for the application
2. **State Management**: Setting up state variables for form data, validation, and submission
3. **Event Handlers**: Functions to handle input changes and form submission
4. **Validation Logic**: Functions to validate form fields
5. **UI Rendering**: The JSX structure that defines the form UI
6. **Styling**: StyleSheet definitions for the component

## Key Techniques Demonstrated

1. **TypeScript Type Safety**: Using interfaces and type annotations throughout the code
2. **Controlled Components**: All form inputs are controlled components with proper typing
3. **Conditional Styling**: Using array syntax to conditionally apply styles
4. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with error messages and type checking
5. **Accessibility**: Adding accessibility props to components
6. **Platform-specific Adjustments**: Using Platform API for keyboard behavior
