# Web Development Timeline Analysis Exercise

## Instructions for Instructors
This file contains the questions and evaluation criteria for analyzing how web development history has influenced modern mobile development. Use this content to create a Microsoft Form that students will access during the exercise.

## Exercise Overview

### Scenario
You are a technical architect explaining to your team how historical web development patterns have influenced React Native's design. Your task is to analyze key milestones in web development and connect them to modern mobile development approaches.

### Time Allocation
- Total time: 30 minutes
- Recommended time per section: 10 minutes

## Part 1: Historical Impact Analysis

### Question 1: Evolution of Component Architecture
**Analyze how the evolution of web development influenced React Native's component model:**

Example response format:
```
Historical Pattern: [Web development pattern]
Year/Period: [When it emerged]
Original Purpose: [Why it was created]
Modern Impact: [How it influences React Native]
Specific Example: [Component parallel between web and React Native]
```

### Question 2: Separation of Concerns
**Explain how the web's separation of content, style, and behavior influenced React Native:**

Example response format:
```
Web Approach:
- Content: [HTML approach]
- Style: [CSS approach]
- Behavior: [JavaScript approach]

React Native Parallel:
- Content: [RN approach]
- Style: [RN approach]
- Behavior: [RN approach]

Key Benefits: [List 3 benefits]
```

## Part 2: Technical Evolution

### Question 3: JavaScript Development
**Trace the evolution of JavaScript and its impact on React Native:**

Example response format:
```
Key JavaScript Milestone: [Feature/Change]
Year Introduced: [Year]
Original Web Use: [How it was used in web development]
React Native Application: [How RN uses this feature]
Modern Significance: [Why it matters for mobile development]
```

### Question 4: Framework Patterns
**Compare historical web framework patterns with React Native approaches:**

Example response format:
```
Web Framework Pattern: [Pattern name]
Historical Context: [When/Why it emerged]
Original Implementation: [How it worked in web]
React Native Adaptation: [How RN implements it]
Improvement/Evolution: [How RN enhanced it]
```

## Part 3: Modern Integration

### Question 5: Cross-Platform Development
**Analyze how web development's cross-platform goals influenced React Native:**

Example response format:
```
Web Challenge: [Historical challenge]
Web Solution: [How web solved it]
Mobile Parallel: [Similar mobile challenge]
React Native Solution: [How RN addresses it]
Advantages/Disadvantages: [List 2 of each]
```
