# Browser vs React Native Rendering Comparison Exercise

## Instructions for Instructors
This file contains the instructions and evaluation criteria for comparing browser rendering with React Native rendering. Use this content to create a Microsoft Whiteboard exercise that students will complete.

## Exercise Overview

### Scenario
You are a React Native developer explaining to your team how browser rendering concepts parallel React Native's rendering approach. Your task is to create comparative diagrams showing both rendering pipelines and analyze their similarities and differences.

### Time Allocation
- Total time: 45 minutes
- Diagram creation: 30 minutes
- Analysis: 15 minutes

## Part 1: Browser Rendering Pipeline

Create a Mermaid diagram showing the browser rendering pipeline:

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% Browser Pipeline
    HTML[HTML] --> DOM[DOM Tree]
    CSS[CSS] --> CSSOM[CSS Object Model]
    DOM --> RT[Render Tree]
    CSSOM --> RT
    RT --> Layout[Layout]
    Layout --> Paint[Paint]
    Paint --> Composite[Composite]
    
    %% Performance Notes
    PN1[JavaScript can modify DOM/CSSOM]
    PN2[Layout is computationally expensive]
    
    %% Style Definitions
    classDef input fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef process fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef output fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef note fill:#fff,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5;
    
    %% Apply Styles
    class HTML,CSS input;
    class DOM,CSSOM,RT,Layout,Paint process;
    class Composite output;
    class PN1,PN2 note;
```

### Required Components:
1. Input Processing (HTML/CSS)
2. Tree Construction (DOM/CSSOM)
3. Layout Calculation
4. Rendering Steps
5. Performance Considerations

## Part 2: React Native Rendering Pipeline

Create a parallel diagram showing React Native's rendering process:

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% React Native Pipeline
    JSX[JSX] --> VD[Virtual DOM]
    VD --> Bridge[Bridge]
    Bridge --> Shadow[Shadow Tree]
    Shadow --> Native[Native Views]
    Native --> UI[UI Display]
    
    %% Add your components here
    %% Consider:
    %% - JavaScript thread
    %% - Native thread
    %% - Bridge communication
    %% - Layout engine
    %% - Performance optimizations
    
    %% Style Definitions
    classDef input fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef process fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef output fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    
    %% Apply Styles
    class JSX input;
    class VD,Bridge,Shadow process;
    class UI output;
```

### Required Components:
1. JSX Processing
2. Virtual DOM
3. Bridge Communication
4. Native Rendering
5. Performance Optimizations

## Part 3: Comparative Analysis

Create a table comparing key aspects:

| Aspect | Browser | React Native | Key Differences |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Input Processing |  |  |  |
| Tree Construction |  |  |  |
| Layout Engine |  |  |  |
| Rendering Process |  |  |  |
| Performance Optimization |  |  |  |
| Threading Model |  |  |  |

## Part 4: Performance Implications

Analyze performance considerations for both approaches:

### Browser Performance
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant JS as JavaScript
    participant DOM as DOM
    participant Render as Renderer
    
    Note over JS,Render: Add your sequence here
    Note over JS,Render: Show performance bottlenecks
    Note over JS,Render: Include optimization points
```

### React Native Performance
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant JS as JavaScript Thread
    participant Bridge as Bridge
    participant Native as Native Thread
    
    Note over JS,Native: Add your sequence here
    Note over JS,Native: Show bridge overhead
    Note over JS,Native: Include batch updates
```
