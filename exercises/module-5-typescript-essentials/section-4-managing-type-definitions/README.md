# Barcode Scanner Integration Exercise

This exercise will help you practice working with type definitions for third-party libraries in a React Native TypeScript application. You'll create type definitions for a medication barcode scanner library and integrate it into your app.

## Exercise Requirements

1. **Create Type Definitions**: Define TypeScript interfaces for the barcode scanner library's functions and data.

2. **Module Augmentation**: Implement module augmentation to add pharmacy-specific functionality to the library.

3. **Custom Hook**: Create a type-safe custom hook that uses the barcode scanner library.

4. **Error Handling**: Handle potential type errors and edge cases in a type-safe way.

5. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to your type definitions.

## Project Structure

The starter code provides:
- A mock barcode scanner library (simulating a third-party library)
- Basic UI for scanning and displaying results
- Placeholder sections for your TypeScript implementations

## Implementation Tasks

1. Create a declaration file (`types/medication-barcode-scanner/index.d.ts`) with:
   - Type definitions for the scanner's functions
   - Interfaces for scan options, result data, and settings
   - JSDoc comments explaining the type definitions

2. Implement module augmentation to add pharmacy-specific functionality:
   - Add pharmacy-specific barcode types (NDC, RxNorm, etc.)
   - Add additional medication details specific to your pharmacy app

3. Create a custom `useBarcodeScanner` hook that:
   - Provides a type-safe interface to the scanner
   - Returns properly typed scan results and error states
   - Handles the scanning lifecycle (idle, scanning, completed, error)

4. In the main App component:
   - Update state variables with proper TypeScript typing
   - Add proper type annotations to the handleScan function
   - Use your custom hook to handle scanning

## Tips

- Use TypeScript's declaration merging capabilities for module augmentation
- Think about how to make your type definitions both accurate and flexible
- Use conditional types where appropriate to handle different scan result types
- Consider using JSDoc to provide additional context for your types
- Remember to handle all potential error cases in a type-safe way

## Getting Started

1. Open the starter code in `App.tsx`
2. Create the types directory and declaration files
3. Work through the "ToDo" items in order
4. Test your implementation to ensure type safety

## Learning Objectives

This exercise reinforces the following skills:
- Creating declaration files for untyped libraries
- Using module augmentation to extend existing types
- Implementing custom hooks with proper TypeScript definitions
- Handling type safety with third-party libraries
- Documenting type definitions with JSDoc
