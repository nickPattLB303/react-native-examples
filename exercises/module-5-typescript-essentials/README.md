# Module 5: TypeScript Essentials

This directory contains exercises for Module 5 of the React Native Training Course, focusing on TypeScript Essentials.

## Exercises

- [Section 3: TypeScript with React Native](./section-3-typescript-with-react-native/): Build a medication tracker application using TypeScript with React Native.
- [Section 4: Managing Type Definitions](./section-4-managing-type-definitions/): Create type definitions for a medication barcode scanner library.

## TypeScript Integration

All exercises in this module use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience. TypeScript provides several benefits for React Native development:

1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
2. **Better Documentation**: Types serve as self-documenting code
3. **Enhanced IDE Experience**: Better autocompletion and refactoring tools
4. **Improved Team Collaboration**: Clearer interfaces between components

## Expo Snack Integration

The exercises in this module are designed to run on Expo Snack, a web-based development environment for React Native. Configuration files like package.json and tsconfig.json are deliberately excluded as Expo Snack handles these configurations automatically.

To run these exercises in Expo Snack:

1. Go to [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/)
2. Create a new Snack with TypeScript
3. Replace the default `App.tsx` file with the content from the exercise
4. Run the Snack on your device using the Expo Go app or in the embedded simulator

## Learning Objectives

After completing the exercises in this module, you will be able to:

- Apply TypeScript to React Native applications
- Create type-safe components and hooks
- Define interfaces and types for your application data
- Work with third-party libraries in a type-safe way
- Create and manage type definitions
- Use advanced TypeScript features like module augmentation
