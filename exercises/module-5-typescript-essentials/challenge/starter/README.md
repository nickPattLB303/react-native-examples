# Medication Types System - TypeScript Challenge

This challenge focuses on creating a well-designed type system for a medication tracking application using TypeScript. You'll create type definitions, interfaces, and function signatures without implementing the actual functionality.

## Challenge Files

The challenge consists of several files:

- `types.ts` - Define your types and interfaces for the medication tracking system
- `functions.ts` - Define function signatures that would use your types
- `README.md` (this file) - Explain your type system design

## Instructions

1. Complete the types in `types.ts` by defining the interfaces and types described in the comments
2. Complete the function signatures in `functions.ts` to work with your defined types
3. Add your own explanations in this README.md file to document your type system design

## Your Type System Design

When you complete the challenge, add your explanation here. Your documentation should:

1. Explain the key types and interfaces in your system
2. Describe how the types relate to each other
3. Explain any design decisions or patterns you used
4. Discuss how your type system would help ensure type safety in a React Native app

## Learning Objectives

This challenge helps you practice:

- Defining interfaces and types for domain-specific data
- Creating type relationships (extension, composition)
- Using TypeScript utility types
- Designing function signatures with proper typing
- Documenting types for a technical audience

## Submission

After completing the challenge, update this README with your explanations and submit all three files.
