# Module 5, Section 1: TypeScript Fundamentals Exercise

This directory contains the "Medication Types" exercise for the TypeScript Fundamentals section.

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, students will implement TypeScript interfaces and types for a medication tracking system, demonstrating their understanding of TypeScript's static typing capabilities.

The exercise focuses on:
- Creating interfaces for objects
- Implementing type aliases with union types
- Using proper type annotations
- Applying interfaces in a real-world context

## Directory Structure

- `/starter`: Contains the starter code that students will begin with
- `/complete`: Contains the completed example solution

## Exercise Requirements

Students will:
1. Define a type alias for `DosageUnit` with specific allowed values
2. Create interfaces for `Patient`, `Medication`, and `Prescription`
3. Apply type annotations to variables and functions
4. Ensure the application runs without TypeScript errors

## CodePen Setup

This exercise is designed to be completed in CodePen. To set it up:

1. Create a new pen
2. Set up HTML (copy from starter/index.html)
3. Set up CSS (copy from starter/styles.css)
4. In the JavaScript section:
   - Change Settings to use TypeScript preprocessor
   - Copy the code from starter/script.ts

## Learning Path Notes

> 🚀 **Self-Led Learners**: Complete the exercise by implementing all the required interfaces and type aliases. Compare your solution with the completed example afterward.

> 🔍 **Instructor-Led Note**: This exercise should be introduced after covering the basic TypeScript types and interfaces sections of the module. Allow approximately 20-30 minutes for students to complete it.

> 🔄 **For Android/iOS Developers**: The interface concept in TypeScript is similar to interfaces in Java/Kotlin (Android) and protocols in Swift (iOS), though TypeScript uses structural typing rather than nominal typing.
