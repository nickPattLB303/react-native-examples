# Module 8 Challenge: Medication App UI Redesign

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you will redesign a single key component from a medication order application with improved styling and responsive design. Rather than overhauling the entire application, you'll focus on creating one polished, professional component that demonstrates your styling skills.

**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Prerequisite Knowledge**: All sections of Module 8

## Learning Objectives
This challenge will test your ability to:
- Implement consistent styling with proper colors, typography, and spacing
- Create a responsive component that adapts to different screen sizes
- Build a custom UI component with advanced styling
- Apply proper styling techniques using either StyleSheet or styled-components
- Implement platform-specific adaptations when appropriate

## Challenge Description

### Context
PharmaDirect has received feedback that their medication order application needs a visual improvement. As the UI specialist, you've been tasked with redesigning one key component to make it more modern and intuitive.

### Requirements

Choose ONE of the following components to redesign:

1. **Medication Card Component**:
   - Create a visually appealing card to display medication information
   - Include medication name, dosage, instructions, and next dose time
   - Implement appropriate typography hierarchy
   - Add visual indicators for medication status (taken/missed/upcoming)
   - Make the component respond to different screen sizes

2. **Medication Input Form**:
   - Redesign a form component for adding new medications
   - Create styled input fields with proper validation states
   - Implement a responsive layout for the form
   - Add appropriate visual feedback for user actions
   - Ensure the form works well on different device sizes

### Technical Requirements

1. Use either React Native's StyleSheet API or styled-components for styling
2. Implement a small, focused design system for your component (colors, spacing, typography)
3. Make the component responsive to different screen sizes
4. Include at least one platform-specific styling adaptation
5. Ensure the component is accessible

## Getting Started

1. Start with the basic component structure provided in the starter code
2. Create a style system for your component (define colors, spacing, typography)
3. Implement the component with proper styling
4. Test on different device sizes

## Hints and Tips

- Focus on one component rather than trying to redesign the entire application
- Pay attention to details like spacing, alignment, and typography
- Test your component on both iOS and Android
- Consider accessibility from the beginning (proper contrast, touch targets, etc.)

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on:

1. **Visual Design**: Is the component visually appealing and professional?
2. **Responsiveness**: Does the component adapt well to different screen sizes?
3. **Code Quality**: Is the styling code well-organized and maintainable?
4. **Platform Adaptation**: Have you implemented appropriate platform-specific styling?
5. **Accessibility**: Does the component follow accessibility best practices?

## Submission Guidelines

Submit your solution as:
1. The component code file with styling
2. Screenshots of your component on at least two different device sizes
3. A brief explanation of your design decisions
