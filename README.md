# React Native with TypeScript Training Program

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive training program for teaching React Native development with TypeScript, focusing on helping native iOS and Android developers transition to React Native.

### Development Philosophy
We follow the principle that "perfect is the enemy of good." Our approach emphasizes:
- Building working solutions first, optimizing later
- Learning through practical implementation
- Balancing best practices with delivery speed
- Making conscious trade-offs when needed
- Documenting decisions and future improvements

## Repository Structure

### Configuration
- `.cursorrules` - Core configuration for training program settings, tooling, and AI communication preferences

### Documentation
- `docs/GUIDELINES.md` - Teaching methodology, communication standards, and technical requirements
- `docs/TEMPLATES.md` - Code documentation templates and standards
- `docs/EXAMPLES.md` - Example implementations and presenter scripts
- `docs/assets/` - Supporting diagrams and visual aids

## Getting Started

### For Trainers
1. Review `docs/GUIDELINES.md` for teaching methodology and standards
2. Familiarize yourself with the templates in `docs/TEMPLATES.md`
3. Study the example implementations in `docs/EXAMPLES.md`
4. Follow the presenter scripts for consistent delivery

### For Students
1. Ensure your development environment meets the requirements in `.cursorrules`
2. Start with the basic component examples in `docs/EXAMPLES.md`
3. Follow the progression path outlined in the configuration
4. Use the templates from `docs/TEMPLATES.md` for your implementations
