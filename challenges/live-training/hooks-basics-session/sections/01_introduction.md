# Introduction to React Native Hooks
⏱️ Duration: 5 minutes

## Setup Notes
- Have IDE open but minimized
- Simulator/Expo Go ready but not visible
- Prepare to share screen when mentioned
- Stand up for the introduction
- Room setup: Ensure good visibility of your screen

## Verbal Script

[Stand up, smile, make eye contact]

"Good morning/afternoon everyone! I'm absolutely thrilled to welcome you to today's deep dive into React Native Hooks. I'm [Your Name], and I've been working with React Native for [X] years, witnessing firsthand the transformation hooks brought to our development workflow.

[Pause for a moment, scan the room]

Before we jump into the technical content, I'd love to understand who I'm working with today. This will help me tailor our examples to your experience level.

First, could you raise your hand if you've worked with class components in React Native?

[Wait for hands, make eye contact with those who raised them]

Excellent! And keep your hand up if you're currently still maintaining any class component-based applications.

[Note the hands that stayed up]

Now, how many of you are already using hooks in your current projects?

[Wait for new hands]

Perfect! This mix of experience levels is exactly what we want for today's session. Those of you coming from class components will see how hooks can dramatically simplify your code, while those already using hooks will discover advanced patterns and best practices that can elevate your implementations.

[Move to computer, prepare to share screen]

Today's session is going to be very hands-on. We're building something real and practical - a smart product card component that you could use in any e-commerce application.

[Share screen, showing IDE]

Let me give you a quick preview of what we'll build:

[Show final component in Expo Go]

This component might look simple at first glance, but it incorporates several key concepts that you'll use in almost every React Native application:
- State management with useState for handling user interactions
- Side effects with useEffect for data persistence and animations
- Custom hooks for reusable logic like analytics and animations

The best part? Everything we build today will:
- Work seamlessly on both iOS and Android
- Be fully typed with TypeScript
- Use styled-components for maintainable styling
- Follow real-world best practices

[Switch back to starter code]

We'll build this step by step, and I'll explain every decision we make along the way. Whether you're coming from UIKit, Android XML layouts, or web development, I'll make sure to draw parallels to concepts you're already familiar with.

Before we dive into the code, any quick questions about what we'll be covering?

[Pause for questions, address any that come up]

No questions? Great! Let's start with the foundation of hooks: useState.

## Visual Aids
- Final component screenshot (assets/screenshots/final-component.png)
- Component structure diagram (assets/diagrams/component-structure.png)

## Checkpoints
- [ ] Audience background established
- [ ] Session goals clearly communicated
- [ ] Final component preview shown
- [ ] Initial questions addressed
- [ ] Energy level set for technical content

## Transition Notes
- Next section dives into useState
- Have code editor ready with clean file
- Prepare to start live coding
- Energy should shift from welcoming to technical focus
