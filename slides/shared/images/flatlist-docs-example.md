# FlatList Documentation Example Image

This is a placeholder for the FlatList documentation example image that would be displayed in the React Native Documentation slides (Section 4).

## Image Description

The image would show a screenshot of the FlatList component documentation from the React Native official documentation website (https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).

The screenshot would include:

1. The FlatList component header and description
2. Key props section highlighting:
   - `data` (required): The array of data to render
   - `renderItem` (required): Function that renders each item
   - `keyExtractor`: Function to extract a unique key for each item
   - Other important props like `onRefresh`, `refreshControl`, etc.
3. Example code showing basic FlatList usage
4. Platform-specific notes about performance

## Purpose in Slides

This image is referenced in the "Component Documentation Example" slide to show participants how component documentation is structured in the React Native docs. It helps them understand how to read and interpret the documentation for components they'll use in their applications.

## Implementation Note

In the actual course materials, this would be a real screenshot (PNG/JPG) of the FlatList documentation, properly sized and formatted for the slides. The image would be named `flatlist-docs-example.png` and placed in the `/slides/shared/images/` directory.
