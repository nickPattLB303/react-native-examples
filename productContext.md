## Learning Paths

The course supports three distinct learning paths to accommodate different skill levels and backgrounds:

1. **End-to-end instructor-led**
   - For participants attending the full 4-week course
   - 1-hour instructor-led sessions daily (5 days per week)
   - 4-6 additional hours of self-directed learning daily
   - Final week dedicated to capstone project

2. **End-to-end self-led**
   - For participants working through the material independently
   - Complete all modules at their own pace
   - Access to all resources and exercises
   - Self-assessment through challenges

3. **Async - learn specific topics**
   - For participants needing to learn specific topics on demand
   - Focus on individual modules or sections
   - Quick reference guides and summaries
   - Targeted exercises for specific skills

## Content Theme

All code examples, exercises, and challenges follow a consistent medication/pharmacy/orders theme. This theme provides a real-world context for the concepts being taught and helps create a cohesive learning experience.

Examples of the theme in practice:
- Components for medication lists
- Forms for prescription orders
- Navigation between pharmacy sections
- State management for medication inventory
- APIs for retrieving medication information

## Exercise and Challenge Structure

### Exercises (15-30 minutes)
- Focused on specific skills or concepts
- Include clear instructions and objectives
- Provide starter code and expected output
- Can be completed in 15-45 minutes
- Include solution code for reference

### Challenges (30-60 minutes)
- Integrate multiple concepts
- Require more problem-solving
- Provide less guidance than exercises
- Can be completed in 1-3 hours
- Include solution code for reference

## Technical Depth

Content is presented at three levels of technical depth:

1. **Surface Level**
   - Basic understanding of concepts
   - How to use features
   - Practical examples
   - Suitable for all learners

2. **Mid Level**
   - More detailed explanations
   - Best practices
   - Common pitfalls
   - Performance considerations
   - Suitable for intermediate and advanced learners

3. **Deep Level**
   - "Under the hood" explanations
   - Implementation details
   - Architecture and design decisions
   - Platform-specific nuances
   - Suitable for advanced learners

## Educational Resources

The course uses various tools and platforms for different types of content:

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React**: CodePen
- **React Native**: Expo Snack
- **Analysis Exercises**: Microsoft Forms
- **Diagramming Exercises**: Microsoft Whiteboard
- **Challenges**: Repository branches with local setup

## Articulate 360 Integration

The course content is designed to be compatible with Articulate 360 for e-learning delivery, following these guidelines:

### Content Development Approach

1. **Repository First, Articulate Second**: Prioritize building a complete, high-quality repository. Articulate conversion is a secondary concern that should not slow down repository development.

2. **Conversion-Friendly Structure**: Create content with future conversion in mind, but don't let it dictate your approach.

3. **Documentation Over Constraints**: Document conversion considerations rather than enforcing strict limitations on repository content.

### Content Structure Considerations

When creating repository content, keep these Articulate-friendly practices in mind:

1. **Logical Content Chunks**: Break content into logical sections that could reasonably become individual Articulate slides or slide sequences.
   
2. **Visual Assets**: 
   - Save source files for all diagrams and complex visuals
   - Consider creating alternate versions of complex diagrams that might need to be simplified for Articulate
   - Use consistent image dimensions where possible

3. **Code Examples**:
   - Break complex code examples into smaller, focused snippets
   - Include clear annotations that can be converted to Articulate callouts
   - Consider which code examples are essential vs. supplementary

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - For each exercise, briefly note how it might translate to Articulate (e.g., "Could be a drag-and-drop activity")
   - Design exercises with multiple difficulty levels that can be adapted to different Articulate interaction types

### Articulate Notes

At the end of each module or major section, include a brief "Articulate Conversion Notes" section:

```markdown
#### Articulate Conversion Notes

**Key Visuals**: 
- Component hierarchy diagram (will need simplification)
- State flow chart (consider animation in Articulate)

**Interactive Opportunities**:
- The component matching exercise could use Articulate's matching interaction
- Consider converting the debugging challenge to a scenario-based interaction

**Potential Challenges**:
- The live coding section will need an alternative approach in Articulate
```

### Asset Management

Maintain a simple tracking system for assets that will need special handling in Articulate:

1. **Create an assets directory** with subdirectories for source files, diagrams, and complex visuals
2. **Use consistent naming conventions** that make the purpose and module association clear
3. **Include a simple README in each asset directory** noting special considerations for Articulate

### Balancing Progress with Conversion Planning

Remember these key principles:

1. **Don't Overoptimize**: It's better to have complete repository content that needs adaptation than incomplete content that's perfectly Articulate-ready.

2. **Leverage Articulate's Strengths**: Some content may actually work better when reimagined for Articulate rather than directly converted.

3. **Separate Concerns**: Keep repository development and Articulate planning as related but separate workflows.

4. **Document Decisions**: When you make choices that might affect Articulate conversion, briefly document your reasoning.
