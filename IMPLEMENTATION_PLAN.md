# Implementation Plan for Production-Ready React Native Application

## Project Overview
This document outlines an iterative plan to build a small, simple application that reflects a real-world, production-ready app using Expo and React Native.

## Objectives
- Create a scalable and maintainable codebase.
- Adopt best practices for production-quality applications.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for iOS and Android.
- Implement state management and performance optimizations.

## Architecture Outline
- Utilize Expo managed workflow and file-based routing with Expo Router.
- Adopt modern state management (e.g., Zustand for global state and React Context/useReducer for local state) along with react-query for data fetching and caching.
- Organize the code in modular, functional components following established conventions.
- Use react-native-paper for common UI components and patterns.
- Apply a custom theme using styled-components to override default styling and support dark mode.
- Integrate with REST APIs/GraphQL as needed and set up effective error handling.
- Use Faker JS to generate and fetch fake data relevant to the app functionality.

## Navigation and Screen Structure
- Use Expo Router with a combination of tab navigation and stack navigation within each tab.

### Tabs
- **Medications**
- **Orders**
- **Account**

### Stacks
- **Medications Screens:**
  - *List Screen:* Display a list of medication names and brief information using fake data. Tapping on an item navigates to the Details screen.
  - *Details Screen:* Show medication details along with options to refill or delete.

- **Orders Screens:**
  - *List Screen:* Display a list of past and present orders with their statuses.
  - *Details Screen:* Provide complete details of the selected order.

- **Account Screens:**
  - An industry-standard user account stack, which may include screens for profile, settings, and other account-related functionalities.

## UI Framework & Styling
- Utilize react-native-paper components to ensure consistency and adherence to Material Design principles.
- Implement a custom theme using styled-components to enhance the visual presentation and support dark mode.
- Ensure responsive design with Flexbox and Expo's useWindowDimensions for dynamic layouts.

## Data, State Management & API Integration
- Set up react-query for asynchronous data fetching and caching.
- Integrate Faker JS to simulate backend data for medications, orders, and account functionalities.
- Configure Zustand for managing global state.
- Implement React Context/useReducer for local state management in complex components.
- Note: Use Zustand for global state (e.g., user authentication, global theme, app-wide notifications) and Context/useReducer for local state (specific screens/components like medication details or forms), following best practices [Mobile at Scale](https://www.mobileatscale.com/content/posts/01-state-management/).

### 5. Screen Implementation
- [ ] **Medications Screens:**
  - [ ] List Screen: Display a list of medication names and brief information using fake data.
  - [ ] Details Screen: Show detailed medication information along with refill and delete options.
- [ ] **Orders Screens:**
  - [ ] List Screen: Display a list of past and present orders with their statuses.
  - [ ] Details Screen: Provide complete details of the selected order.
- [ ] **Account Screens:**
  - [ ] Implement multiple screens (Account Overview, Profile, Settings, Payment) based on industry-standard practices.

### 6. Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Implement lazy loading and code splitting for non-critical components.
- [ ] Use memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) to optimize component rendering.
- [ ] Integrate error handling and loading states into data fetching operations.

### 7. Testing & Finalization
- [ ] Test the application on both iOS and Android platforms (using simulators or devices).
- [ ] Verify adherence to coding conventions, performance best practices, and responsive design.
- [ ] Run Prettier and ESLint checks as part of the final review.
- [ ] Document all changes in CHANGELOG.md for traceability.
- [ ] Finalize documentation, perform code reviews, and commit the finalized code.
