   - Uses visual explanations
   - Makes platform-specific connections

5. **Tooling and Development Environment**
   - Uses appropriate platforms for different content types
   - Provides Expo Go setup instructions
   - Follows repository branch structure
   - Includes local development instructions

## Repository Structure

- `main`: Contains README.md with navigation instructions and course overview
- `docs`: Contains all text-based documentation in markdown format and HTML/CSS slides for live training sessions
- `exercises/<EXERCISE_NAME>/starter`: Starter code for exercises
- `exercises/<EXERCISE_NAME>/complete`: Completed examples for exercises
